While there is a small sample size, Candlestick Analysis has had a 100% success rate on the ticker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.americanbulls.com/SignalPage.aspx?lang=en&Ticker=PLTR](https://www.americanbulls.com/SignalPage.aspx?lang=en&Ticker=PLTR)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means that if you traded the ticker based solely on this indicator, to date, you'd have a won all your trades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis makes sense if you consider CSTA was developed to track the rice trade in the 18th century, and with the ticker being picked up by a lot of retail investors and hedgefunds probably trying to avoid tickers mentioned on social media.

My post and comment history should show this.\n\nMy argument:\n\nAMC is, and had ALWAYS been, a distraction from GME.\n\n6 months ago, \"AMC is dead!\" was all you saw. Everyone was all \"What's the point if I can stream at home and not have to pay $20 for two drinks and popcorn?\" or \"I can pause and go take a shit and not miss anything at home!\". I made bank on $2 AMC puts because I like money. It was almost to $1.\n\nDisney released Mulan direct to streaming on their app.\n\nHBO released Wonder Woman 1984 direct to streaming on their app.\n\nNow we're all \"Save AMC!!\"??? \n\nJust seems odd, in my opinion, that this movement started at the exact same time that the GME drama was unfolding. As if someone at a HF said \"We're going to stop the squeeze, that's easy, but we have to distract and divide the play. Let's throw some heartfelt nostalgia at them. They won't be able to resist!\" (This is obviously not even taking any of the CLEARLY bullshit plays people have been trying to start... Hi, SLV)\n\nI cannot find record of this magical 13f filling showing GSA Capital bought $270,000 worth of AMC that's being reported on various websites and other subreddits. Maybe you can? But if you can't find it either, I'm calling foul.\n\nI CAN find PROOF that Silver Lake Group, LLC, one of the largest tech equity firms, either completely sold or converted about 33m shares...

Me too.\n\nI'm in AMC, but I don't plan on adding more unless more ACTUAL news (with proof) should come to light.\n\nMaybe I'm right? Maybe I'm wrong? I've got skin in the game because I want to be wrong, but I have a sneaking suspicion otherwise. You do realize that the recent Forbes article about \"Amazon to buy AMC?\" was an idea originally rumored back in May 2020. This isn't new news.
