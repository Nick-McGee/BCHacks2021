It's not a tech company and it's on the LSE. It even pays dividends! \n\nJust like BB and NOK, that's exactly what they want you to think. While we are chasing TSLA, APL and other big tech. The smart money is holding RR, BB and NOK. \n\nRR isn't a car company. BMW bought the RR brand. RR instead are a heavy industries and tech company. Their main business is Jet engines, with side ventures in Nuclear power plants, rocket engines and ship engines. \n\nJet engines: unless you've been under a rock these last few hours you will know that a jet engine blew up recently. That engine was attached to a Boeing 777 and was a Pratt and Whitney engine. NOT A RR ENGINE. \n\nThe scare from this event might ground all P&W engines, it might not. But what it will do is give manufacturers (airbus and Boeing) a clear reason to choose RR over their main competition. Airbus already use RR engines, Boeing uses it on some of their back room stock. If they do get grounded, RR will go to the moon (we'll come back to that) if they don't,  then it still bullish.  \n\nNuclear power: RR have developed small scale nuclear power plants.  With Texas losing power, small nuclear back up power plants might be seen as an alternate way to ensure 24/7 power to a local area. Oil, gas are on the way out and while sustainable power is good, nuclear will play a big role in meeting the needs of the future. \n\nShip engines: RR make the engines for the Royal Navy (the fourth largest Navy in the world) including the engines for HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. \n\nThat means RR is a crucial part of the UKs defence system and as such will not be allowed to fail. Thats right, it doesn't matter how bad RR finances get, the UK government will bail them out. Because they aren't going to allow their new multi billion dollar aircraft carriers to go out of service due to mechanical failure. \n\nNot only that but Boris Johnson is investing into the Royal Navy like no conservative Prime Minster before. There are 8 new Royal Navy Frigates currently being built with the Australian Navy in line to order 1 for themselves.

During the rebalancing at the end of January, $AMOM sold all of its $TSLA holdings of 6.7% (third in the portfolio ranking) during the rebalancing process.\n\n$AMOM ETF has recorded a cumulative return of 79.33% (TR) and outperformed the benchmark by 36.28%p (TR) since listing on NYSE in May 2019 and is showing the best performance among the US large-cap momentum ETF category. So, you may expect that the market timing of $AMOM is also relatively accurate. We analyzed in detail whether $AMOM is really good at Tesla stocks' market timing.\n\n**Fact 1)**\n\nAfter $AMOM bought the first Tesla stock at the end of April 2020, there have been only 3 cases that the weight of Tesla stock in the portfolio is zero. During the 1 month after rebalancing to 0, the actual Tesla's monthly returns were -14.56% (2020-9), -11.96% (2020-10), and -3.3% (2021-02, not over yet). In fact, these three months are the only months that Tesla stock has recorded negative returns since May 2020.\n\n**Fact 2)**\n\nWhen $AMOM buys Tesla stock once, it gradually increases its weight and then sells all at once. Until now, Tesla\u2019s stock price has been showing negative returns without exception during the period from the selling of the entire volume to the re-buying of Tesla, which can be seen as a good market timing of AI.\n\n**Fact 3)**\n\nThere is a significant linear relationship between the weight of Tesla stock predicted by $AMOM at the end of each month and the actual monthly return of Tesla stock for the following month. Although there are few samples, the correlation coefficient of 0.84 / R\\^2 value is shown to be about 0.7. This means that the weight of Tesla in $AMOM, which changes at the end of each month, predicts Tesla stock's next month's return. (In other words, the higher the weight of Tesla in $AMOM during rebalancing at the end of each month, the higher the next month's Tesla yield.) If the weight of Tesla in $AMOM is calculated to 0, the actual value is negative (short) weight in the AI engine, so reflecting this, the correlation coefficient and R\\^2 value become larger.\n\n**Fact 4)**\n\nThis is the result of combining luck and actual predictive power, and this predictive power may change in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi2qix4ffui61.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=8947d28aabfe32806e6ec6e6402ed6101cd8038f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8h15d6nfui61.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd542b077e8b48fc975659a210e2835f13eb157", "comments": [{"body": "Buy and never ducking sell $TSLA. \n\nEasy and no quants needed.", "created": 1613919428.0}, {"body": "no it hasn't \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAI is the high frequency pc's that trade\n\nthey're modulated by volume based on the news\n\nthey fuck up the entire market\n\nby fucking with the volatility in forex\n\n&#x200B;\n\nstop fudding over yourself\n\nstart seeing balance", "created": 1613919497.0}, {"body": "Ready to watch my cheap calls I bought Friday print next week.", "created": 1613920254.0}], "created": 1613918812.0}, {"title": "Calgary, Canada opens the first Psychedelic drug therapy clinic", "text": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/first-clinic-to-use-psychedelic-therapy-in-the-province-opens-in-calgary-1.5919714\n\nIf we continue to see this level of acceptance and understanding from governments across North America and beyond, I can't see how psychedelics, more specifically mushrooms, won't have a huge market space.

Why were those stocks specifically picked when you chose to restrict\n\n6.\nVlad, Why did you restrict buying of shares and options when you could have made restrictions on options alone to satisfy what you claim were increased margin requirements. When someone has cash to purchase shares that are not on margin why restrict them?\n\n7.\nVlad, free and efficient markets would dictate that if there were ever a moment in which stock needed to be paused, it would have been paused for both buying and selling and that options contracts would be adjusted for time. Why was this not your approach?\n\n8.\nWhy didnt the SEC step in and halt trading\n\n9.\nWhy does IBKR say they were worried about locating shares? Why were shorts not forced to close their positions?\n\n10.\nVlad, did Robinhood reachout to the SEC for recommendations regarding how to handle the AMC and GME stock before cutting off retail investors and not Hedgefunds?\n\n11.\nMelvin, do you know what a short ladder is?\n\n12.\nMelvin, were you aware there was a handful of traders after the stock was restricted that were using a shortladder technique to further drive down share value of AMD and GME? Their trading charts were almost identical which is a statistical impossibility unless automated systems were artificially brining down those shares.\n\n13.\nMelvin, did you increase your short interest in GME during the January 28th retail stock restrictions?\n\n14.\nMelvin, do you or anyone at your company have any have knowledge of contact with media, including social media, to spread false information regarding GME or AMC?\n\n15.\nCitadel, do you or anyone at your company have any knowledge of contact with media outlets, including social media, to spread false information regarding GME or AMC?\n\n16.\nVlad, were you or anyone at Robinhood in contact with Interactive Brokers about GME or AMC, anytime in the leading up to the January 28th stock restrictions?\n\n17.\nVlad, the ceo of Interactive Brokers admitted on live TV(Feb 17th) that if buying restrictions were not set on retail investors then share price of GME would have forced shares to go into the 1000\u2019s.

A layman's GameStop analysis & how the company should proceed forward operationally", "text": "ETA a TL;DR: Comparing GameStop to Micro Center might be like comparing apples to oranges, but GameStop can learn one big thing from them: People like buying PC parts. Here's the strategy: 1. Make changes to operations on a store level 2. Sell pre-owned PC parts 3. Profit.\n\n\\---\n\nWarning/Disclaimer: This shit is long. Also, not financial advice.\n\nHopefully it's ok to post this here. I have lurked for a while, recently actually joined the sub. This is not as much market analysis as it is an analysis of how GameStop has failed as a company in the past, and what we as investors should push GameStop to do in the future to encourage company growth. If you like the stock, I'd like to think that this is a collection of reasons as to *why* you should like the stock.\n\nI'm going to try and simplify this as much as possible.\n\nSo, I used to work at GameStop, and was an assistant manager (ASL) for a while. I will make it clear that this does not make me an expert on everything that goes on within the company and I make no claims to that kind of knowledge. I just have experience with how the store operates on a day-to-day basis, and how individual GameStop stores make money.\n\nThis is how GameStop stores make money, in a nutshell::\n\n\\--Pre-owned game/accessory/console sales\n\n\\--Trades (though this has lessened greatly due to stores halting trading due to Covid)\n\n\\--'Collectible' sales (Think T-Shirts, Funko Pops, statues, Pokemon cards)\n\n\\--Upsells (replacement plans (PRP), disc protection (GPG), 'pro' membership)\n\n....and that's pretty much it. Most everything else in the store has significantly smaller profit margins, except maybe some accessories. GameStop buys games at $59.95 and sells them for $60, pretty much. At least, as far as I know. I'm sure there are exceptions to this.\n\nThe problem with this model is that, especially because of the pandemic, the gaming market is rapidly becoming a digital playing field. It was steadily becoming that even before Covid, but Covid certainly accelerated this. Most of my day at work was selling PSN and Xbox cards to people, which we make basically nothing on, and is also impossible to upsell.\n\nNot only is this an issue, but GameStop also has this vicious internal cycle with their employees. It is well-known they treat their employees... not great. This can be summed up into stores not meeting numbers because their upsells aren't really beneficial to the customer, and also because employees see no cut of the success beyond a pat on the back and the fact that they get to keep their job. Employees get chewed out if they don't meet what can seem like impossible expectations, and this rapidly turns into employees' sales tactics becoming forced and desperate, which results in a negative relationship with the customer. Stores are also very small physically with a very small amount of employees. It's hard to sell well when you have 20+ things to do that day that don't involve customer interaction. This kind of store-corporate relationship leads to high turnover and gamestop customers feeling uncomfortable during register interactions, which lessens the amount of returning customers, which makes numbers harder to hit...\n\nLike I said, vicious cycle. So, the question is, how does GameStop fix these things? I think that casting their net wider is something that has been suggested/hinted at and something that they should be doing - however, I think they are wary to do so. GameStop has tried this in the past - they just cast their net in the wrong direction by purchasing companies like Simply Mac.\n\nThey shouldn't be investing in pre-owned phones... but if they want to keep the pre-owned model and also have happier employees, there is something they can do.\n\n\\------\n\nI think that the easiest way to explain this is to look at a company with a similar business model that is vastly more successful and has much better PR. I also used to work for this company, and the same disclaimer as GameStop above applies here as well.\n\nHave you heard of Micro Center before? If you live in the US, you probably have - they're a small retail chain that sells a wide variety of tech hardware and software, but they're best known for selling PC components brick-and-mortar, which is kind of a rarity these days. For the most part, everyone loves Micro Center! Employees are knowledgeable and friendly, they act like they actually want to be there, and they sell cool stuff.\n\nSo, what does Micro Center do right?\n\n\\--Commissioned employees, and employee training that doesn't just involve around selling\n\n\\--larger physical stores, less stores in general, and waaaay more employees per store\n\n\\--their upsells actually make sense and benefit the end user\n\nMicro Center is a company that cast their net in the right direction. Sure, there is stuff they aren't very profitable on, but they still continue to sell it in case a customer wants to buy it in the future. They have a big enough selling floor that it's easy to hang onto years-old inventory. On the stuff they do sell, their margins are razor-thin, but they make up for that by selling stuff alongside these items that have HUGE margins and that customers are almost guaranteed to buy (think thermal paste with a processor, or video cables/adapters with a GPU or monitor purchase).\n\nNot only is this beneficial to them, but their upsells (which are very similar to gamestop's, just a little more complex) are cheaper than gamestop's by the dollar, are much easier to take advantage of, and have better policies in general. This makes more customers buy these upsells if they are presented properly.\n\nSales employees are also on commission. Some people may see this as a downside, but it is a big upside for the company and, while it can inconvenience employees, it's part of having a sales job. Employees are competitive and very friendly with customers. The business model for selling (I won't get into the nitty gritty here) encourages employees to help customers purchase within their budget or save money, so there is not an issue of overselling for the most part. The employees they attract are often usually enthusiasts who are genuinely interested in what they are selling, and often excited to sell - not just for the money, but because it's fun for them and the customer. They also delegate most operating tasks like the register and inventory to hourly employees who don't sell.\n\nMicro Center isn't perfect by any means, but they are coming out of the pandemic *much* better than GameStop. In fact, they grew during the pandemic - some of this was just due to new hardware launches, but it was also due to customers desperately needing equipment to work from home like laptops, headsets, microphones... All in all, they profited from the pandemic and they still did pretty well with social distancing/cleanliness guidelines (even if customers weren't that happy about it sometimes).\n\n\\-----\n\nSo, what can GameStop learn from Micro Center?\n\n\\--Maximize profit/product margin in any way you can. Micro Center will literally buy out warehouses of old product to sell in stores even if it isn't necessarily part of their main market. Last holiday they had a bunch of drone toys that were like $5 a pop. They weren't great, but they were $5, and they sold like hotcakes... cuz they were five bucks! They also sell drinks and snacks, a lot of them being the kind of drinks and snacks that 'nerds' tend to enjoy (G-Fuel, Hi-Chew, and Pocky being excellent examples)...\n\n\\--In lieu of the above, GameStop needs to pinpoint its market and cater to it by selling shit they will actually buy. Impulse buys are an important part of this.\n\n\\--stop selling so much third party stuff and sell lower-quality stuff from your own brand name. Not everything needs to be super fancy - sometimes consumers just want, say, a $10 pair of earbuds with a mic versus a schmancy $50 headset. I will admit to not knowing the intricacies of this, but Micro Center cells 'Inland' brand products, which is their brand, not only in the store but on Amazon as well, and the margins on these products are incredibly high while still staying beneath what other places sell them for.\n\n\\--get bigger stores, get less stores. This way, stores don't have to constantly move product around as much(GameStop frequently has stores ship between each other to balance stock), you can have more employees per store, and you can also have the space to sell more obscure shit instead of sending it back to rot in your warehouse.\n\n\\--give your employees a cut. even if it's not full commission. give employees a percentage of upsells and profits, and improve your upsells.\n\n\\--invest in what your 'dream' customer base in interested in. I.E. Esports, game streams, content creation, enthusiast stuff. GameStop TV *sucks balls.* (if you don't know, it's a 45 ish minute stream of ads that runs on repeat)  Replace that shit with family friendly stream content. Your employees will thank you and your customers will spend more time in your store.\n\nAnd, the last thing is what I was alluding to much earlier. If GameStop wants to continue to utilize its pre-owned model, it needs to adapt to something that CANNOT practically be digital.\n\nPre-Owned computer hardware. Laptops, full gaming PCs, PC components.\n\nOf course, there are caveats to this. Some components probably need to undergo rigorous testing, but with larger stores this could very well be an option. If they are able to refurbish consoles at their warehouse it is most certainly a possibility. Regardless, a place other than craigslist to sell pre-owned computer stuff would have customers *flooding* gamestop stores to purchase well-loved 1080s and 2016-era gaming rigs for half of what they were worth a couple years ago.... and GameStop can still make a profit from this. A big one. Computer parts hold value longer than console stuff and have a much wider market.\n\n\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^ This. This is what GameStop needs to do, and it's why I fucking like the stock.  This would be Gamestop casting their net into what is basically a Scrooge-McDuck level ocean of cash just waiting to be tapped into. This is why you should like the stock. As shareholders, we NEED to push GameStop in this direction if it is going to survive the steady conversion of media to the digital format. I want to see a day where hedge funds don't even want to *try* to short GME because they know it's got value. Whether or not GameStop will do this, or anything similar to it, is up in the air, but we most definitely have the power to influence it.\n\nIf you read all of this, I'm sorry you had to put up with my naive idealism for so long. I don't have a lot of knowledge on the corporate level for these companies, but I know what GameStop has done wrong on a store level and what could potentially be done to increase foot traffic, profit, and, in the end... how valuable the company is as a whole.", "comments": [{"body": "No TL;DR, so didn\u2019t read.

A TLDR post about PLTR stock from technical analysis point of view as many people might be interested to jump in due to FOMO syndrome but can't bear the idea that they did not bought @ 25 and now are left in such an internal turmoil all of us have probably experienced - buy now and take the pill or wait for the dip?\n\n[Price chart, MACD, and RSI values.](https://preview.redd.it/e95x6eisqti61.png?width=2614&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f50f4974b867f360f8d90d83bbaa0e58d922cd)\n\nThe **price chart** reflects few key points:\n\n(1) absolute fucking bottom @ 25$;\n\n(2) likely upcoming resistance @ 30-31$ range, which is in line with 200 days EMA.\n\n(3) closing Friday price @ 29$ and extensions of gains to 29,75$ in after hours on Friday.\n\nSo from the price chart analysis we can see the likely areas where PLTR stock could struggle next week at 31$ price tag, as it the area of previous strong support AND is in a tandem with 200 days EMA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* *FAQ* \\- just tell me is price going up or down next week and should I buy or sell???\n* *Answer* \\- Well who knows. From technical standpoint, there are 3 metrics which can help determine the direction AND likelihood of breaking the 31$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MACD** \\- a fancy term used to quantify, or \"measure\", *momentum*. From the current data it seems that there is a strong positive momentum, in my opinion as a result of both, high institutional (shout out to Cathie and fuck you WS) and retail investors interest.\n\n**RSI** \\- basically indicates whether the stonk is bought or sold more over the specific period of time, reflecting *demand* for shares. ATM it is at 67, which is another bullish sign for the stock, because it could likely increase even more (my guess 80 would be top value considering that those insiders who wanted to sell had a chance to do so for 2 days).\n\n**Volume** \\- last 2 trading days had 630M shares exchanged, whereas only 400M of shares were unlocked on Thursday (which is \u00b122% of float). Given the price action following the lock up expiration, which increased >20%, combined with a RSI metric showing strong interest in long positions, I think this is a strong bullish sign.\n\nSo what is likely scenario for the next week with a price? IDK, imo it will go up and face stronger resistance @ 31$/unit. If I had to answer this question in exam, I would say it will break 31$ by the end of the week given the:\n\n\\-(1) strong momentum;\n\n\\-(2) high demand for long shares from institutional and retail sides;\n\n\\-(3) high volume facilitating the price movement in response to \u2191 MACD and RSI.\n\n\\*A lot also will depend on broader market sentiment and whether we are green/red in indices, albeit it is less important in case of PLTR, but still important to keep an eye on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* *FAQ* \\- what happens if we break 31$ price tag?\n* *Answer* \\- most likely this will become a new strong support (as 25-26$ area was the strong resistance of PLTR before the Demo day) and the stock will enter a bull run towards new ATHs. (w/ some resistance in late 30s ofc)\n\nFor those who can't take the pill and pay 29-30$ a share for a PLTR  because they had a chance to  buy @ 25 and did not use it, I would suggest to place a buy limit order @ 31.25$ because this is likely that after this level we wont dip below 31$ below anytime soon. For those who does not want to risk premium I would just place an at market open order and buy desired amount.\n\nAnd for those want short term gains i would suggest to go and try to lick your own anal aperture.\n\n**Disclosure**: non financial advice, non advisor and other bullshit I saw everyone states after DD.

These opinions are my own and not investment advice. \n\nSundial has terrific profit potential. They have a $45 million spac in zenabis that returns 14% + 3% of revenue royalty. So that\u2019s another at least $9 million from weed cultivation and sales that goes on the income statement as finance income when it\u2019s really 100% weed based and is same as operating if not better because gives diversification. The senior debt is only good until 2025 but they will be able to find similar deals with other companies when rates are even higher if sndl isn\u2019t bought out by then. \n\nNot to mention they have zero debt and $690 million cash on hand which could be another $104 million in annual income at the same 15% return of zenabis deal. Even though hexo bought out Zenabis SNDL still owns the senior debt as of now. SNDL will likely acquire small US company to get easy access to US Market, maybe Grapefruit USA, but ultimately Sundial is as profitable as it wants to be. They could be making $75-100 million a year but they are focusing long term and will likely make an acquisition instead. Don\u2019t forget they recently paid off all their debt and have no more capital raises left on the shelf. \n\nSNDL has terrific long term fundamental metrics. Anyone who values weed companies on a revenue multiple is a fool. Sndl cut 50% of workforce in 2020 to focus on profitability and transitioned from strictly growing to more of a direct retail presence which has much higher margins and lower revenue. It\u2019s competitors dump all their cash into revenue and advertising and it\u2019s not comparing apples to apples.\n\nSundial is such a high quality company that could have double or triple its current revenue if it liked burning cash but it doesn\u2019t and turned a normalized operating profit last quarter. In an up-and-coming budding industry it\u2019s easy to say weed stocks are overvalued but once the long train gets going, it won\u2019t look back. \n\nWeed \ud83c\udf31 is the new alcohol and cigarettes combined, and the industry is about to break into drinks. The stock went down last year from $13 because their first grow at the large indoor facility wasn\u2019t done well and they had mold issues and had to write off profit. They addressed the issue, changed management, put in new processes and stock went down 40 fold.\n\nThe 10K should be released in mid March and then analysts will update their estimates and price targets about a week later. Not to mention potential national decriminalization. So many catalysts the next few months. I predict we get to $5 then $10 this year- no guarantees. \n\nI owned fcel and bngo before they took off and was astonished with their run. SNDL could absolutely do the same thing. Things take time and it may be a rocky road but the company is setup for huge success in the future. It will likely get acquired in next 5 years anyway. The market judges potential as much as results and SNDL brings massive amounts of both. Good luck to everyone either way! \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/canadian-cannabis-company-sundial-acquires-special-purpose-vehicle-for-about-86-million-2020-12-30\n\nhttps://sundialcorpprod.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/tK3jQ8CZ93QVVajmGtVf8Awp?sp=r&sv=2016-05-31&se=2021-02-16T00%3A16%3A34Z&rscd=inline%3B+filename%3D%22Sundial+Growers+Inc.+-+Q3+2020+FS.pdf%22%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8%27%27Sundial%2520Growers%2520Inc.%2520-%2520Q3%25202020%2520FS.pdf&rsct=application%2Fpdf&sr=b&sig=qj7fwGLZH4VjHhK929g0wOyCKDlcOfaxcHtriWVUiRQ%3D\n\nhttps://sundialcorpprod.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/wxPVPdxPEWwV3sYZms7viTuH?sp=r&sv=2016-05-31&se=2021-02-16T00%3A13%3A49Z&rscd=inline%3B+filename%3D%22Sundial+Growers+Inc.+-+Q1+2020+FS.pdf%22%3B+filename*%3DUTF-8%27%27Sundial%2520Growers%2520Inc.%2520-%2520Q1%25202020%2520FS.pdf&rsct=application%2Fpdf&sr=b&sig=Y7AVT3%2B8%2Fs0mWbihjl6xpsZNF3ugU%2Bx5aHIIwXVFdk0%3D", "comments": [{"body": "My issue with SNDL is that they continue to issue and dilute shares more and more.

This is the general checking account from which the US makes all of its purchases. [Here's what it looks like now](https://i.imgur.com/ogJzIue.png).^1  The government raised $1.6T and its just been sitting there, not used.\n\n**So?**\n\nWell, for context, currency in circulation has risen from about [$0.8 trillion in January 2007 to $2.07 trillion today](https://i.imgur.com/vndHJ7h.png).^2\n\nWe know the Fed has been buying Treasury assets at a decent clip of around $120B per month since last year. Zooming out just a little, lets put into context that currency we just looked at as part of the [liabilities of the Federal Reserve](https://i.imgur.com/UlJwNtv.png) ignoring repos, which for reference are relatively small.^3 \n\nAlright great, so we now know there's a lot of money out there already, but the Department of the Treasury is sitting on 1.6T that's been printed but hasn't actually been sent into the economy yet.\n\n**Why does this matter now?**\n\nThe interesting news then, is that Yellen [has made it clear she'll be reducing this cash pile, *quickly*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-16/yellen-shift-on-vast-treasury-cash-pile-poses-problem-for-powell). Whoa, hold up. So what are the effects of this going to be? Glad you asked. \n\nAll this cash is going to flood the financial system with liquidity. Credit Suisse is calling this unleashing a \"tsunami\" of reserves into the financial system, swelling Fed reserves from $3.3T to about $5T.  \n\nPreviously, banks have been able to absorb the excess liquidity in the system, but they have limits and need to manage their own liabilities. So this $1.6T needs to find somewhere else to go. The likely alternative is the money markets. \n\nIf you're getting 1.6T in free cash money, you might as well park it in low yielding treasuries while you figure out what to do with it. But those are already trading at about 0. That means these short term yields are going to head toward negative territory. And at some point, the money markets will stop taking in new money. There's only so much appetite for investments that actively lose you money.\n\nLet's think about the implications here. \n\n**Possible Implications**\n\n* Short end of the yield curve is going down.\n\n* The Fed may have to raise short-term rates like IOER, interest on excess reserves, during their March meeting.\n\n\n* People will hear that the Fed is raising rates in March and think that the Fed is scared of inflation and thus raising rates, when they're just trying to accommodate the extra liquidity. If this causes a market sell off, it will be a massive buy the dip opportunity.\n\n* The yield curve may steepen. \n\n* As we know, 10 year bond yields have been flying higher lately, [up to 1.34%](https://i.imgur.com/Bb351OL.png) currently.^4 This has been likely action in anticipation of reflation, perhaps even inflation. The rate of change here has been pretty aggressive, and I find that concerning, because it may lead to volatility caused by news that's not fully understood. \n\n* Rates on the long end may keep increasing in anticipation of inflation, despite the low end being heavily depressed.\n\n* Higher rates on the longer end *may* lead to a sector rotation out of riskier equity assets to beefier 'value' stocks.\n\n* All this additional liquidity will probably be a risk-on event. Buy. The. Stocks.\n\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMassive liquidity increase incoming. Equities might briefly dip, but then up. SPX over 4000 within a month. SPX 4500 a month after that. As much as we're up already, we're melting the fuck up from here.\n\n\n-------------\n\n**Sources**\n\n1.  [Treasury General Account](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTREGEN)\n\n2.

Currently at 1.26%.**\n\nFor reference (sourced from iborrowdesk):\n\n* On 1/4/2021, the fee was 23%\n* On 1/15, 2021, the fee was 45%\n* On 1/26/2021, the fee was 84%\n\nSince 1/27/2021, the borrow fee has been decreasing exponentially even though we've collectively been buying and hodling the shares hand-over-fist.  **Again, the borrow rate to short-sell is only 1.26% now.**\n\nWant to know why?  It's because all of you autists use shitty brokers like RobinHood to buy up the stock in droves into accounts that have Instant Settlement / Margin turned on by default.\n\nWhen you have Instant Settlement enabled, it makes your account a Margin account.  When you have a Margin account, the broker is free to lend out the shares  (like to the twats over at Melvin Capital) for shorting.\n\n**If you have a cash account, the shares are bought and settled directly into your account, and the broker isn't allowed to lend these shares out to short sellers.**\n\n**The more $GME stock that WE buy into a margin account, the more cheaply the hedge funds are able to use the shares to short it.**  RH publicly posts on their '*How Robinhood Makes Money*' page that they participate in loaning stocks that are on margin for interest income.\n\n**How to prevent this on RH:**\n\n1. In the RH app (iPhone), Account Tab -> Investing -> Day Trade Settings -> 'Turn Off Instant Settlement' to convert your account to a Cash account\n2. Withdraw all of your leftover money/positions and put re-deposit it into a better brokerage.  Because fuck RobinHood anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**(BONUS INFO)**  How short interest can be over 100% ***without*** naked short selling (which is what a lot of people think happened):\n\n1. Autist A buys 100 $GME shares into a margin account on Shit Broker A (RH1 for short)\n2. RH1 lends these 100 shares to Shit Fund (MC for short) to sell short\n3. MC short-sells these 100 shares on the market, and Autist B is the buyer into their Shit Broker B (RH2) margin account\n4. Now RH2 lends these 100 shares to MC to sell short, which Autist C later buys\n\nThe same 100 shares have now been sold short twice boosting SI%, but the float hasn't changed on the stock.\n\n**The only way to win this battle against the hedge funds is to cut off their ability to short the stock so cheaply.**  If they can short the stock for *virtually* free, dollar-for-dollar, against retail traders, this squeeze will never get squoze.\n\n**TLDR:** Switch your $GME-holding brokerage account to a cash account.  Collectively force the hedge funds pay a much larger premium to short the stock.  Force them to cover.\n\nAs always, do your own DD.

It\u2019s their job to do this every single day, this isn\u2019t an unforeseen business anomaly. And that\u2019s less than 3% of money managed.

Just a thank you note, President's Forward and random ads.\n\nBut then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there's a strange coincidence.\n\nGamestop's real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.\n\nRight underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.\n\nI was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords.

I think I found a bubble within a bubble thats easier to gain on with the right catalyst.\n\nGamma squeezing ARKK is no simple task but the IV and premiums on the ETF are prime for some major tendies. I'm still building up the idea but I don't know if it's possible just due to the 'aunt Cathie' crowd. However, I decided to start a position on Friday and take one for the team.\n\nLooking through ARKK weight on their top holds for the ETF, especially CRSP, PSTG, and NVTA could setup for major drop on certain tickers. \n\nCRSP they own 8.58% of open float and its 3.17% of their ETF\nShort float is 4.60%\n\nPSTG they own 7.86% of open float and its 2.04% of their ETF\nShort float is 6.3%\n\nNVTA they own 9.08% of open float and its 3.09% of their ETF\nShort float is  16.26%\n\nOther tickers that they own way to much of the float are PRLB(11.53%),IOVA(7.67%), TWST(6.80%), NTLA(10.90%), TWOU(11.65%), PD(9.37%), MTLS(10.75%), EDIT(10.62%), VCYT(7.23%), IRDM(5.49%), SSYS(12.05%), MCRB(9.54%), CERS(11.35%), CGEN(11.96%), SYRS(10.95%)\n\nLarge cap equities that stick out to me as a potential issue to front load their ETF on a pullback are TSLA, ROKU, SQ, TDOC, BIDU, SPOT, and Z where the current percentage of these equities in their ETF makes up 36.75% of their weight. I know they maintain the average weight of TSLA from 8-12% depending on the price action in order to maintain an average of 10% of the total ETF.\n\nThough I'm not overly concerned with the weight of any major equity within their ETF, I am a bit concerned with the weight of the overall open float for many of their holdings. With a small correction in the tech and bio bubble they will definitely be the front runner in dumping.\n\nThe reason I am looking at ARKK in anticipation of a correction is that the IV and premium of puts is insanely low in comparison to the individual equities. It's hard to bet against ARKK since its cult like, but this is staying on my radar\n\nI put together a table of the current shares on Friday close for ARKK that includes ARKK % of the float that they currently hold for the individual equity in their ETF and I highlight a few other key components such as Previous day average range, short float %, and ARKK current weight for each equity within their ETF.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/vuqB1gN\nhttps://imgur.com/vuqB1gN\n\nHere are some pretty options strategies that show how Green this correction can be with a huge IV spike\n\nCurrent IV\nhttps://optionstrat.com/9Ok2M2FpsL\n\nIV with a gamma squeeze to 110%\nhttps://optionstrat.com/LDOIMJKUOw", "comments": [{"body": "You understand that arkk is actively managed?

A few minutes later, it did not appear to work, so I attempted to sell again. Subsequently, my account showed that both \"sells\" went through. Then my account had the cash from both sales, and a negative balance of shares that I was required to deliver in 3 days.\n\nAfter seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing (without limit), I freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss (\\~$180k). If I was lucky and the price went down, I could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain, and could have kept my mouth shut (not that I would have). But instead I'm out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug, and Schwab owes me about $180k.\n\nHad I not covered this erroneous short position, the shorts probably would have become what we know to be \"Failures to Deliver\".\n\nI have attached the record of what happened below, which I sent to Schwab soon after the event, to try to get the situation undone. I eventually was able to call their support team and they said I would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation.\n\nThe guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug, in other equities too. I can't recall the complete conversation.\n\nAnyway, I recently got a message in the system that I would have to wait \\*another\\* 30 days. So I flipped my shit and now I'm posting about it here. Please don't comment about how retarded I am for investing my retirement in GME. That's not the story. I do what I want, I like the stock, and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded I am, and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on.\n\nI have no information about how many naked short positions were created, other than it was more than just myself, and in other equities as well. I have no information about whether or not the bug still exists. I did not test it. It may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem, as far as I know.\n\nRelated: I recently posted something that made me suspicious to /r/stocks \\- [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i\\_strongly\\_suspect\\_that\\_schwabameritrade\\_does\\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnvero/i_strongly_suspect_that_schwabameritrade_does_not/)\n\nI didn't realize this until today, but I connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my Schwab retirement account. i.e. Schwab+TD are the same company, and these two things could be related.\n\nHere is the message I sent to Schwab (for a record of what happened). You might notice that it's a 401(k), which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading, but it is a self-managed fund, and individual stocks are actually allowed:\n\n\\------------------------------- START OF MESSAGE -----------------------------------\n\nTo whom it may concern:\n\nMy name is ####### #######, my account number is ####-####\n\nI attempted to call your 1-800 number several times, but I was unable to get through to your support. Here is a breakdown of what happened:\n\nThere is a bug in your system that caused my non-margin account to briefly become short GME shares. My account is a non-margin 401(k) account. In good faith, I spent $430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into. Two trades need to be undone.\n\nAt market open, my position this morning was NNNN shares of GME.\n\nAt 11:09, I attempted to place a market order to sell NNNN shares: Order #AAAAAAAA\n\nThe order did not show up for about 10 minutes. My account balance still showed NNNN shares, so I attempted to make a similar order again. I placed a sell of \"Limit Or Better\" to sell NNNN shares at $125. Order #BBBBBBBB\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I got confirmations for BOTH ORDERS, and a notice that the account was due securities. I DO NOT have a margin account, and it should not have gone short, the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account.\n\nOnce I realized what the system did, I saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in, and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account, I did a market buy at 11:44AM for NNNN shares using the \"Buy to Cover\" button, which zeroed out my position in GME. Order #CCCCCCCC\n\nThe erroneous trade needs to be undone, and my buy to cover also needs to be undone, as both of these are not legal trades for my 401(k).\n\nOrders #BBBBBBBB and #CCCCCCCC should not exist on my account. #BBBBBBBB is a result of a bug in your trading system, and #CCCCCCCC  was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem.\n\nI'm sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened, and I will refer to it when I call again when your call volume is reduced.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------- END OF MESSAGE -------------------------------------\n\nDisclosure: My current positions in my 401(k) are as follows, ignoring what Schwab owes me:\n\nGME: \\~4500 shares\n\nCash & Money Market: \\~$180k.\n\nAgain please don't comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing strategies.

This means that the model gives the future price a 95% chance to be within the range of the shaded-red area in the chart. The solid red line is most likely the mean predicted price (best price estimate) for the model, and in the 50-day prediction this line is all the way at the bottom of the chart. In fact, the red area you see would also stretch down to -130k if the price could actually go below 0, the model just knows that it can't.\nSo the reason the red area stretches so high for the 50-day prediction is that the model is so uncertain about the price in 50 days, that it does not know whether the price will be 0 or 100k. Check out the 10-day prediction and you might see what I mean.\nEdit: I'm not saying I have any idea what the price will be in 10 or 50 days, but the big confidence interval shows us that the model can't tell us with any certainty either.\u201d\n&nbsp;\n \n***\n>The stock price does not matter.

Already set up, and instead of competing, GameStop could literally just *buy* these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord (or leave them as is, just own the revenue streams).\n\nThere are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub (epicenter, really) for such a massively exploding industry (an industry with zero sign of slowing down. Ever). \n\nEntertainment as an all-things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable, and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly. *Interactive* entertainment is just unrivaled.\n\n3) **The man, the legend, the boyfriend to all of our wives, DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr. G, just doubled his shares position.** He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock, and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values (remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up? I didn't do the math, and I'm not gonna, but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100% of those profits into shares anywhere near the top).\n\nBecause of this, he has negative downside risk (GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead). I'm in a much *much* smaller, but similar boat. I made $100K, and kept 100 shares, which I fully intend to take to my grave. This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place.\n\n4) **GameStop will never be forgotten.** This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time. The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon. Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes, the world will always *always* remember \"G.M.E.\"\n\n5) **I am just fine, financially.** My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue. This is not a YOLO play. I can afford to lose the money I am putting in. Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance. See above, where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist, so there's no money anyway.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n- Buy *as many shares* as I can afford, never expecting to see that money ever again.\n\n- Sell a few covered calls way in the future, at or out of the money. As they approach expiration, roll them forward another year. This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops, or secure (and yes, limit) upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value. As long as these options do not get exercised, I will still own the shares. I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25-35% cash ROI every year (see below somewhere).\n\n- As I earn more money externally, buy more shares. Again, as many as I can afford. Every. Single. Year. Just constantly expand my position. No matter what. Forever.\n\n- ????\n\n- Profit, never. Not ever sell a single share. Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to, you guessed it, buy more shares.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemember, my goal here is to own shares, not to make money. Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares. Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares.\n\nCurrently at-the-money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 (about a year out) are effectively worth 35-40% of the value of the stock. Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY, then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35% each year. Yes, there will be a decrease in IV in this case, but using externally-earned money I should be able to make up the difference.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n- **First milestone:** overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume. I will never beat his % gains, and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns, but that is fine. My goal is purely share count. \n\n- **Second milestone:** overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume. My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares. I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type \"ryan cohen gamestop shares\" and I'm not gonna. Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated. I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone, as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life, before I get old and die.\n\n- **Third milestone:** Own, run, and manage GameStop. Whatever that means. Member of the board, sure? Bust in on meetings like \"Hey I own most of this place, someone grab me a coffee.\" and then yell about how \"I pay your salary!\" as I'm being escorted out by security, more likely. But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table, even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old, or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nWith this strategy, cumulatively expanding my position by 35% YoY, I should be able to turn a 1,000-share portfolio into a 8million-share portfolio in 30 years. This is just based on current prices, options values, and my current income.\n\nIt couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1, $0.50, or $0.25 per share. At a certain point, cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock.\n\nI like this stock, and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **only** disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan (it's not even a strategy at this point), would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised, calling all my shares away from me, increasing my net worth by 35% all at once. \n\nOr if GME just does really well organically, which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares.\n\nBecoming a millionaire would be cool and all, but I'm trying to do something specific here.\n\nSEC interns: I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone. I just like the damn stock.\n\nHedgies and MMs: please crank up your algos to maximum. Never stop doing what you're doing. I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY.\n\nCurrent \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c shareholders: you are the only thing standing in my way, and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme-ass prices. If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits, I will thank you for it. If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it (maybe shoot for buying back in lower), I'd appreciate that even more.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually, whatever. Might be a little bit to get started, as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better. But hey, I have 30 years to get this sorted out, right?\n\nMake fun of me as I lose money. Ask me for advice as I make money. Call me an idiot for the platforms I use. Try to sell me access to your crappy web-based indicator research tools. None of it will matter. Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin-toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable, I suppose.\n\n**tl;dr - there is no tl;dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates**", "comments": [{"body": "I really just need to know what size Frosty you want, sir...there are other people waiting to order.", "created": 1613861949.0}, {"body": "\u201cI will **own** gme\u201d\n\n* *invests $1000 into gme*", "created": 1613861147.0}, {"body": "I need to start a small business.

All three firms privately own and sit on the board of the DTCC. If naked shorting occurred in GME, there's good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the DTCC may have shut down 1/28 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary \"collateral requirements\" stated**\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my\u00a0[last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lma1ev/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/), I hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in GME, prime brokers and the DTCC (which is privately owned by the prime brokers) would need to be complicit in it, which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 1/28 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons.\n\nOn the question of whether DTCC was right to shut down trading on 1/28 based on collateral requirements, I'm not an expert on this subject but I've seen many compelling arguments against it, including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for Robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million (per following DTCC's special requirements) and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin? And why was selling allowed but not buying, why not shut off both? Another interest point is that the DTCC has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the DTCC is privately owned by Prime Brokers/Banks.\n\nOne question posed to me by a reporter was \u201cwho are the prime brokers involved\u201d? So I decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form\u00a0[https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)\u00a0which shows that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin Capital\u2019s three largest prime brokers (based on assets held under custodianship). As a reminder, if these prime brokers did allow naked shorting and the short squeeze had occurred, pushing prices to thousands per share, the hedge funds would likely not be able to pay that and prime brokers would be left holding the bag to cover (which would also suggest they would be disincentivized to margin call)\n\nAll three firms own and sit on the board of DTCC\u00a0[https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board). (Note that National Financial Services (Fidelity) is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 1.16 billion each for Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley, and 265 million for JP Morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot (03/2020).) I found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board.\n\nNote, the same Goldman Sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases (Source:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)) and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement. Also the same Goldman that accidentally leaked it\u2019s own emails (while defending a naked shorting lawsuit) that implicated itself and other banks in participating in naked shorting, including quotes like \u201c**We are NOT borrowing negatives... I have made that clear from the beginning. Why would we want to borrow them? We want to fail them...\" and \u201c\\[stock is\\] trading at negative rebate with non-paying customers\u201d (naked short). In one email Goldman Sachs tells a client** \u201cWe will let you fail.\u201d (FTID, trade a stock without locating it) and an email from a Goldman, Sachs hedge fund client, who remarked that when wanting to \u201cshort an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it\u201d he would then be \u201cshocked to learn that \\[Goldman\u2019s representative\\] could get it for us.\u201d (Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054857/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054857/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/))\n\nAnother interesting datapoint is that Goldman was chosen as the firm to take Robinhood public\u00a0[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328), so alongside with the Robinhood Citadel relationship (As it relates to selling order flow and RH making making 40%+ of their total revenue from it) there\u2019s also a relationship between Robinhood and Goldman Sachs, who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the IPO.\n\nThe thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 1/28 shut down (which short squeeze was set to occur, and when Interactive Brokers CEO projected price would\u2019ve been in the thousands\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today\\_interactive\\_brokers\\_ceo\\_admits\\_that\\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/)) is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in GME, because if it did then the Prime Brokers involved and DTCC would likely have been complicit, they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting.\n\nAs long documented by counterfeitingstock.com, \u201cthe short hedge funds,\u00a0**the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)**\u2014make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated\u2026 The counterfeiting of shares is\u00a0**done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers**. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including\u00a0**Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting**\u2026 Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is\u00a0**carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC**\u00a0and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail. The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. (Source:\u00a0[http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html))\n\nA former economist who worked in operations at the DTCC, Susanne Trimbath, even came out in this\u00a0insightful [article](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)\u00a0and blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the DTCC, I highly recommend you read the full article. Just to highlight one part of it, Timbath says \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement. It allows them to punish those who don\u2018t deliver by refusing to have them in the system\u2026 **The DTCC has for years ignored that\u201d** (Source:\u00a0[https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)). In laying out the case of whether naked shorting exists in GameStop, the nature of naked shorting means it's not easy to prove and there have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because of that, but if you\u2019re an investor in the trade you\u2019ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks GME has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock, including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 2/1 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped. These things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred. In the case of GameStop there are several very strong signs/indicators that naked shorting has occurred.\n\n**I will list some of the indicators that Naked Shorting occurred in GameStop below:**\n\n1. One indicator is GME's extremely high number of Fail to Delivers ([www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)), which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time. The website\u00a0[www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)\u00a0shows extraordinarily high FTIDs extending from 2020 to years back. Michael Burry tweeted that in May 2020 when he lent out his GME, it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares\u00a0[https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en). FTIDs can happen for a number of reasons, but to have this high number of FTIDs over a sustained period of time is highly unusual, and a stock with a high number of FTIDs is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured.  \n \n2. Short Interest in GME has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100% of float. As of January 15th short interest was 226% ([https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl)) of the entire float. While it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100% with brokers repeatedly leading to each other, short interest this high at 226% of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured, which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short.  \n \n3. Institutions alone have held a staggering 177% of float as of 1/31 according to Bloomberg Terminal\u00a0[https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)\u00a0which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that GME is rampant with counterfeit shares. Another interesting datapoint is Fidelity's calculation of retail ownership is only 0.1% float ([https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW](https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW)) which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true -- another potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined\n\nOn Monday 2/1 there was a momentous price drop, and that drop continued through the week. Given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze, the price drop made little sense, especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there should've been an upward price pressure. What makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder, described below:\n\n*\"Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit... By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of \u201cstrategic fails-to-deliver\u201d and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand\" (Source:* [*http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html*](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)*)*\n\nIn an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up. As of 2/1 with GME's reported short interest declining with price also dropping, there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover, which is in regulation of Reg-SHO -- and again, this assertion is supported by the high numbers of FTIDs GME has consistently reported.", "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to put this together.

I would skim by every now and then and see loss porn and a bunch of people calling each other demeaning names. The post blew up more than I thought it would, so after unintentionally causing a [war](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5tfal/a_reminder_for_everyone/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=share) between two subs, I thought I would actually engage with you guys and give the sub a decent shot. So I hopped onto my alternate account as to prevent the possibility of backlash. I didn\u2019t buy any of the mentioned stocks, but I had conversations with other traders and grew to like the community.\n\nI discovered a new source of memes that I never would\u2019ve imagined--everywhere from diamond hands and tendies to apes and a questionable amount of guys married to women who had boyfriends. Then GameStop happened. I bought a share at 75 after it fell from about 150. I mostly just did it for jokes, but was surprised to see it soar to more than 200 shortly after. I ended up buying more at every dip I found. Life was good, at least until brokerages halted trading. It became evident to me that this was nothing less than a class war between the suits and everyday people like us. Nothing was done about the 140% short float, yet the second regular people started making money, suddenly there was an issue. I mean, seriously, the SEC investigating Reddit? \n\nEven while certain brokerages halted trading, I watched in astonishment as people from other countries were posting huge orders, letting us know that we weren\u2019t alone, and we continued holding strong. Even as this subreddit was temporarily shut down for some time, we continued holding strong. Even as one of the sub\u2019s mods was kicked off, we continued holding strong. Even as DFV was called to testify, we held strong. I\u2019m still holding onto GME and AMC with diamond hands. No way I\u2019m selling at a loss. Now some people have asked me: Why are you still holding? Two reasons.\n\n1) There\u2019s no way that short float dropped to 60% without the price going up. GME and AMC [remain two of the most shorted stocks](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today), and I\u2019m thoroughly convinced that HF\u2019s have someone else holding their positions for them so that they can legally tell the public that they\u2019ve closed out their positions when in reality, they\u2019re still out there. It\u2019s honestly just a waiting game at this point. Someone on here once compared our situation to a staring contest in which we\u2019re allowed to keep our eyes closed while HF\u2019s have to keep them open.

When I stumbled across this stock I was instantly confused. They went from an all time high of $21 in 2014 to a current share price of $1.46. Over the last 6 months they have declined all the way from $8.74 to $1.45. So why is this stock getting beat up you\u2019re probably asking? Well, it\u2019s being priced for bankruptcy. They\u2019re balance sheets aren\u2019t looking great and they currently have $8,000,000,000 more in liabilities than assets which has been exacerbated by Covid-19. With a number like this it makes sense why the common investor would be bearish and stay shy. We\u2019re different in this community and let me explain why I\u2019m bullish. I did some research and found out that Rolls Royce makes most of its money from the number of hours it\u2019s engines fly. I then found out that Rolls Royce is a national treasure of England\u2019s, and England would try very hard to keep supporting them. I also learned that they have large contracts, some of them worth more than $1,000,000,000 alone. So you\u2019re telling me the market cap is $10,000,000,000 and they have a tenth of that in 1 single contract? They operate in 50 countries and have customers in 150 more. They are the second largest competitor in the engine industry(behind general electric) but are priced for bankruptcy? They literally can not go bankrupt. Their balance sheets look scary but they are so well established and relied on all around the world. If the stock went up 2x or 3x it would still be less than half of what it was trading at pre covid. The opportunity is unreal. And for a little more hope if you weren\u2019t already into it, they\u2019re working on electric engines and space travel. Yep. 2 things we love here.

However, I have a strong belief that they are going to CRUSH the earnings estimate and have a very green end of the week.\n\nBut... Why?\n\nWell - besides spending far too much time here with you all, I also spend much of my time owning/managing 3 airbnb's in the Chicago area.  Annnnd I have a new one I purchased in Saugatuck, MI that I have been renovating to prepare for the spring/summer 2021.\n\nSurely this does not qualify me for anything?\n\nListen.\n\nBack in March/April 2020 when shit really started to hit the fan.  Basically ALL of our summer reservations for the Chicago units cancelled.  It was panic mode, literally cancellations left and right because of covid.  This is not news.\n\nAt the same time Airbnb was in panic mode, they trimmed 1,900 of 7,500 employees.  Oof.\n\nThen something miraculous happened.  We began getting bookings again for the summer.  Many more, and bookings were over double in the average length we normally get (read = more profitable). Very soon our entire summer was booked as normal with a new type of guest.  We were seeing many people who now had the freedom to work wherever they wanted travel to Chicago for weeks on end, rather than a weekend.  They would just work M-F and then explore when they wanted.  It was a new type of Work-Vacation? if you will.\n\nOur summer revenue was right on par with what we would consider a \"normal\" summer - truly remarkable given the circumstances.\n\nFast forward - I am living in Michigan prepping the new Airbnb.  I frequent the downtown area and chat up many of the shop owners to get a feel for the area and what the past summer was like as this is a major vacation destination.  In short, every shop owner reported the same thing.  Every weekend was like the 4th of July (typically the busiest weekend of all summer).  Basically all fo them reported that they saw record numbers of people and absolutely smashed their previous \"best months\" of sales and what not.  This trend has continued all the way through January 2021 I've heard, shops reporting record January sales.\n\nIn addition to this there is swaths of data showing the trending increase in short term rentals like Airbnb, VRBO, Home Away, etc.  and a trending decline in hotels.  I don't anticipate this trend changes anytime soon.\n\nSo. In summary.\n\nAirbnb anticipated the worst (as did I) and trimmed employees to cut major costs.\n\nWhat actually happened was a mini boom in short term rental demand as people sought alternatives vacations that did not require flying and people took advantage of remote work.\n\nAirbnb cut costs anticipating the worst, then saw comparable levels if not increased levels of business in many markets.\n\nI think Airbnb is going to crush earnings and am YOLO'ing the rest of my deteriorating account into calls expiring Friday.\n\nI do not work for Airbnb or anything, I am simply a friendly host who is overly confident in his ability to predict the future.\n\nI hope I don't get banned or get this removed cause I can't show my positions, but I had this epiphany today and obviously can't buy calls till Monday, but you can bet your wife's boyfriend's Tesla that that is what I'm doing.", "comments": [{"body": "It already has a $120 Billion market cap and is up 50%.", "created": 1613855906.0}, {"body": "I think this is a really interesting take on Airbnb.

This is because of the rising domestic demand and iron ore prices, higher international prices and subdued production and limited imports. As a result, it could be among the key factors for automakers announcing a price hike on its entire model range.  \nDespite the current market conditions, Tata Motors has seen a significant increase in its demand for its passenger vehicle range. The sales of its cars grew by 39 per cent in the first three quarters of the current financial year as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.\n\n**JSW Steel\u2019s net profit jumps** ***14 times*** **to Rs 2,669 crore backed by a strong recovery in steel demand for the three months of October-December** [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/jsw-steel-s-net-profit-jumps-14-times-to-rs-2669-crore/ar-BB1d0CDZ)\n\n>\"Various high frequency economic indicators are better than the initial expectations pointing to a robust recovery.

Overall value added and special products sales were up 12% y-o-y, making up 57% of overall sales versus 51% in Q2FY21.

This would likely boost spot prices.\n\nThis is indeed good news for steelmakers around the world, **because this would mean that Chinese export prices will no longer be among the lowest in the world** and would reduce the competitive pressure on suppliers in the Asia Pacific region, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and India.\n\nThere is more granular detail to be found in the various ferrous markets, depending on demand and supply fundamentals, as well as how big a part China plays in these markets.\n\n# Steel Demand\n\nSteel Dynamics Chief Executive Market Millett says he's seeing no indications that demand for steel in the US will weaken soon. \"It's intriguing to me that there is concern about the strength of the market because right now it's absolutely incredible,\" Millett told analysts. \"We can't supply enough steel currently to the appliance and HVAC,\" markets. He's expecting auto production to expand this year and says steel demand even from the energy industry -- the company's weakest market -- is showing \"glimpses of a turnaround.\" Shares down 1.7% at $37.78.\n\nI do not think the banks believe this is real.\n\n[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/11/chinas-iron-ore-prices-spike-10percent-to-a-record-high-on-supply-concerns.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/12/11/chinas-iron-ore-prices-spike-10percent-to-a-record-high-on-supply-concerns.html)\n\nSupply concerns have spiked prices, but also, increased demand in finished goods - large appliances, construction materials - rebar, fasteners, steel beams, steel plate, etc\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/soaring-metals-prices-signal-bets-on-global-economic-recovery-11607250600](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/soaring-metals-prices-signal-bets-on-global-economic-recovery-11607250600)\n\n[https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3966372/STEEL-SCRAP-WRAP-Prices-hit-highs-on-tight-global-supply.html](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3966372/STEEL-SCRAP-WRAP-Prices-hit-highs-on-tight-global-supply.html)\n\n# Retail Attention\n\nI first discovered steel because I read from multiple people on multiple stock discords that they know people in the steel industry or are in the industry themselves and steel demand is insane right now. Supply isn't keeping up.\n\nAnd look at this post from Vitard member u/EverythingGunz\n\n*I run a construction business up in Canada, build 3-4 residential houses a year and maybe 2-3 commercial projects a year. My suppliers are Kent\u2019s, Home Hardware and Home Depot. As some of you may or may not know, lumber (a commodity) Is extremely expensive right now. On average a house of 1500 sqft or more is costing 20k or more to build than the same time last year due to lumber price increases. I was just told by all my suppliers that now anything steel is also going up in price to meet lumber and they expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. So we are talking nails, screws, fasteners, clips, hardware, hangers, etc all going up in price the 1st of april. I know this is just a small part of the steel industry but it\u2019s promising considering the current boom in the housing and construction market.*\n\nAnd another post:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2klfe2znzoi61.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4041bda0f7022acfc60fbcf0489a306b6bc88c3\n\n# TLDR\n\nI don't want to sound like a shill and I have no reason to be a shill, but I think that steel is a worthy gamble to place your bids on. There is a huge potential for a steel mania run, all the indicators point towards it, and we are early on in the speculation part of mania. I am not a financial advisor, just a retarded high schooler, but this is something you should definitely take some time out of your day to do some research into.\n\n# Bonus\n\n While steel should be a medium-length speculative hold, I think that $CLF will have a good week.

Why did they not also halt selling?\n\nBy halting buying only, that forced the price down since most retailers were using Robinhood at that time! That is market manipulation!

Senators need to ask this question and I would like to get it to them!\n\nHad Robinhood simply halted buying AND selling on Jan 28th, Then those securities would have been safe the following days and not just plummeted. People would have purchased on other brokerages and the stocks would not have been forced down. After re-opening with new capital the stocks would have kept rising as expected. But they didn\u2019t because of Robinhoods actions!\n\nThis is enough evidence for me, to prove their guilt and that they actually had intentionally tried to drive the price down to protect their customers. Those customers mainly being Melvin and citadel (the ones who had short positions on these stocks) as we know from the hearing. We are the users, not the customers.\n\nI\u2019m just a retard though so maybe I\u2019m missing something.

We\u2019re discussing them because most people who reported issues on Jan 28 were using Robinhood. I didn\u2019t look into the other ones, so I\u2019m not discussing them. I wasn\u2019t even trading GME on 1/28 I was trading CTRM and could not buy, just sell, so I panic sold since I did not understand at the time what was happening and didn\u2019t want to lose my money.\n\nI don\u2019t have much invested that I\u2019m worried, but I just feel like I watched a terrible crime be committed in front of me and no one is talking about it.\n\nIf you have evidence that another brokerage had stopped buying only and not selling, then they\u2019re guilty too.\n\nEdit2: So as a few have pointed out this was actually discussed in the hearing, once, very briefly. With ranking Reb memeber McHenry at around minute 53:00 or shortly after. I went and listened again, and still did not like the answer provided, but it was there at least once. I feel like they moved on to easily from that and it should be discussed a bit more. They faced lawsuits either way and customers were going to be upset either way, I don't know if I believe that things would have been worse that way or not, but the point is that it was addressed so I am wrong on that point.\n\nEdit3: Leaving this post up and all of its discussion for anyone else who has this question can see it and get their answer.

So call me a shill and I'll John Travolta meme at your comment.\n\nDo I think AMC price will go up eventually? Yes, absolutely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you think that 99.2% of AMC stock is held, you're wrong. Look at Disney. It's at 99.9%. Does that mean that only 0.1% of people are selling Disney? Is Disney gonna moon to $1000 all of a sudden? NO. You need to LEARN about what these values mean. Let's explain why none of what you're believing is true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r00crx1w1oi61.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=050aff5674cc7c9aee852525003c54ee5d1e14c3\n\nLook, I get it. Some of you are well versed in stocks and just freshly made a Reddit account. Some of you are new to the world of stocks in general. And some of you just can't fucking spell correctly in your titles. You heard the hype and joined in for the fun or possibility of profit. Well, educating yourself is the best thing you can do. The last thing you wish to become is sheep, following what others say without being able to understand if what they say is true or false.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's begin:\n\nThe main example today - the bullshit 99.2% of **all** AMC shares being held.\n\nWow, do you fucking hear yourselves? Does that sound even remotely like it makes any sense? You truly believe that out of the entire world, 99.2% of all people that own AMC stock are simply holding it? For one moment, try to remember that Reddit is not the world. There are, as impossible as you might think, people that own AMC stock that are not part of this subreddit or any others. Think of all the automated algorithms that day trade vast quantities. All of them only amount to 0.8%?\n\n\"But I saw 99.2% on some screenshot of some website!\"\n\nYou sure did. But did you know what that 99.2% was actually indicating? No, of course not. It's a far more blissful experience to see the number, hear some fuckwit tell you it's gonna moon **based on that**, and then you post \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c and scratch your head why it didn't happen a week later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what it actually indicates: there's a 99.2% ratio of the **float shares** to the **outstanding shares**.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, like half the posts in [r/explainlikeimfive](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/), it's really fucking simple to Google. Here's an extremely dumbed down version:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutstanding Shares: all the shares of the company including **institutional** shares + **restricted** shares\n\nInstitutional Shares: shares that other companies hold in that stock.\n\nRestricted Shares: shares potentially for employees. You as a retail investor don't have access to these.\n\nFloat Shares: all the shares minus the **restricted** shares. This is also called the **PUBLIC** float because it's the amount of shares that are available on any given day for the public to trade with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSooo, using words instead of numbers for some quick algebra, what have we concluded?\n\nFloat / Outstanding shares simply means all of the AMC shares that are available to the public. 99.2% of all the shares (outstanding share) of AMC are available for the public to purchase (float share). This percentage is BASED ON some website's analysis and the actual numbers will of course be different depending of what website you look at because no one actually has the precise number.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: The 99.2% of all amc shares being held statement is FALSE.

Most of their portfolio is low and no carbon emission generation, and moving in that direction long term.\n\nAs a company, they continue to trade at undervalued prices.

Looking NEE\u2019s energy breakdown by source (data from Sustainability>Overview>By the numbers on NEE website ), 58% of generation comes from Natural Gas +Nuclear vs 53% of VST. The difference is looking at the coal generation of 5% for NEE vs 20% EBITA for VST. If VST got rid of 15% of coal generated EBITA, and traded at NEE\u2019s valuation, it would be $83 a share.

What happen?\n\nSo I've been thinking about it and it seems like the *very last fucking thing* that the SmArT mOneY dickheads want to happen is for something like that 0.1% FTT to be implemented.\n\nIf you were watching the hearing, you probably noticed that as soon as this tax was mentioned, that was *instantly* the focus from Citadel, Melvin and Robinhood.\n\nI mean, I'm generally against adding more taxes, but am I right in thinking that it could actually fuck over HFT entirely?\n\nThink about it: When the average retail investor makes a trade, unless we're talking about a big-ass YOLO or something, you're usually looking at a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in value being traded, right? 0.1% is ONE dollar for every thousand. $1k per $1m. A single, solitary penny on each $100. If you're a fairly active retail investor (and not, like, doing this as your primary income) you might make a few trades per day, and you're generally looking to get some decent value out of every trade.\n\nHFT does the opposite. High Frequency Trade, for the uninitiated, is automated trading governed by AI and algorithms that can spot a market move in an instant and take advantage of it, no matter how small. When I say \"small\" I mean *fucking small*. On average, a HFT bot is making *one-twentieth* of a *penny* per trade. \n\nBut even if the profits are so small per trade, these bots are trading so goddamn fast that it generates insane total profits, considering the amount of profit per trade. Of course, when I say \"fast\" I mean *really fucking goddamn fast*, and it's only getting faster. \n\nThe SEC authorized automated trading in 1998, and about a year after that, trades were being completed automatically in a few seconds per trade. Mind-blowing shit at the time. By 2010, the time per trade was measured in milliseconds, or thousandths of seconds. This is the timescale you're used to seeing internet latency (aka, ping time or lag) measured in, like it takes 20ms for an electronic signal travelling at the speed of light to get from me to NYC. Anyway, these trades kept getting faster. \n\nThese days it takes about **one-hundredth of a microsecond** for an HFT bot to execute a trade. That's 0.00000001 seconds. A hundredth of a thousandth *of a thousandth* of a second. There is nothing this timescale can be compared to that would make sense to the human brain - it's literally unimaginably fast.\n\nSo figure this - $0.0005 on average being made per trade at the assumed maximum rate of once every 0.00000001 seconds. This isn't likely to happen in any kind of sustained fashion, but just to get a sense of what we're dealing with, lets assume perfect conditions and it's making these trades as fast as it can. That's a maximum potential of $50,000 *per second*, also assuming it's exactly 50-50 buys and sells. On top of all that, these HFT bots make up for about half of all trading volume every single day.\n\nNow, let's get back on topic - the tax. The US actually *does* already have a tax like this, it's just so small you don't even notice it. Fucking small; about 2 cents per $1,000 traded, or 0.002% Yep, the suggestion is to take the tax we already have and multiply it by 50. This tax is excised on both ends of the trade - remember this, it'll be important in a minute.\n\nTurning that to up to 0.1% is still peanuts for us guys that make a few to a few-dozen trades a day. Hell, it probably wouldn't make an appreciable difference to any actual humans trading, period, regardless of how much money they're throwing around. \n\nWhat it does impact, to a catastrophic degree, is HFT. As described above, a *tiny* profit on a single trade, half a tenth of a penny, can churn out huge sums of money when you can do that 10 million times per second. Currently, HFTs generally follow a few criteria: Share price under $50, low volatility (beta <1.5ish), and a market cap over $50bn. \n\nLets run our previous example that got us to $50k in profits in a single second, making $0.0005 profit per trade, assuming $50 share price and at current FTT rate of .002% - that $50k in profits is going to carry $10k in tax along with it. \n\nNow, multiply that tax figure by 50 to get what it would be under a 0.1% rate. $500k in taxes on $50k in profits, because the actual *amount* that you traded in that time frame ($50 a share x 10m trades) is $500m churned in a single second.\n\nThere would be absolutely no way for HFT to exist at this tax rate, at least under current strategies. But if you're not generating tiny profits as fast as you can, then what even is the point? That's the whole game in HFT! Yet, it's the exact thing that's punished the hardest with higher FTT rates.\n\nDoes it seem like I've got any of this wrong? I mean, it's possible, I'm no professional, just some dumb money retard trying to make sense of shit. \n\nThe other thing is, running HFT is pretty fuckin expensive. Not just in the computer hardware to do it, but you need to have the fastest connection possible and ideally a location as close as possible to the exchange to make it work it's best. Check on how expensive office space is in a short proximity to the NYSE. This is why access to HFT is generally restricted to the largest institutions because they can afford all of the above, and once they have it established, it's basically an infinite money pipe. As long as it's trading and the bots are running, they're making money.\n\nAll this brings me to the point I'm most interested in. Let's say the 0.1% FTT actually passes (I doubt it ever will, but what if?). Some people say that HFT benefits the market by closing up B/A spreads and increasing liquidity. Personally, I say it sounds like bullshit being pushed by HFTers as an excuse to hang on to their money faucets. What would, or could, actually happen if HFT dies out? What other impacts could the 0.1% FTT have that I might have missed?", "comments": [{"body": "Yes, a TINY transactional tax of 0.1% (you put $1000 in, $1 is taken in taxes) would completely shut down HFT.

Intel is experiencing a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced.\n\nLast week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis).\n\nToday I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nINTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move. The main reason for the 65$ strike is that the volume and open interest is high so transacting these contracts is easy and the  ask/bid gap is very small (in this case .37/.36) **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast price for this option contract was at .36$ \\* (100) = 36$ per option contract\n\nAs of market close and after hours INTC shares are trading at 63.06$  or 3.08% way from being in the money. Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find \"beating\" this option contract a more than 50% probability.\n\nTo illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts.\n\nFor every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price.\n\nReiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.\n\nNow I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space.\n\nFan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math).\n\nMicron: 3.08% upward move contracts < 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.\n\nTSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.\n\nI wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%.\n\nGiven the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the \"real\" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite.\n\nSimilar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks).\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market.\n\nI am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win.\n\nI have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term.\n\nFor the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them.\n\nThis is deep fucking value.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**", "comments": [{"body": "You need to learn how to format your shit but Godspeed retard.

The words following this are merely my own thoughts and should only be consumed for entertainment purposes only. Invest and trade securities at your own risk.\n2. **What They Do:**\n   1. DoorDash is a food delivery commodity business that works to give consumers and merchants an avenue and one stop shop to place orders and receive food. Door dash makes money from three revenue streams:\n      1. The first revenue stream is collected through the fee it charges customers to place orders through their app and website. This fee varies by location and time of day of the order but is generally 5 to 8 dollars per order.\n      2. The second stream of revenue is from the commission that DoorDash takes for every order which is paid by the restaurant. Door Dash\u2019s commissions on restaurant orders are about 20% per order which is among the highest in the industry. Grubhub in contrast takes roughly 13.5% commission per order.\n      3. Their final stream of revenue comes from advertisements. What I mean by this is that restaurants pay door dash to appear at the top of the search results on the website and their app platform. \n3. **Industry Outlook:** DoorDash is not the only food commodity delivery service that is good at throwing money into the furnace. However they are by far the most efficient at it and despite this fact they are the most euphorically valued company in the space compared to Uber Eats, Grubhub, and other local miscellaneous food and commodity delivery platforms. For instance in 2019 DASHs revenue was $885,000,000 dollars whereas grubhub\u2019s revenue was 1.312 billion. Dash posted a net loss of $616,000,000 whereas grubhub posted a loss of $6,283,000. 2018 is the same story with DASH bringing in revenue of $291,000,000 and posting a loss of $210,000,000 whereas grub hub brought in 1B in revenue and actually posted a net profit of roughly 81.5million. One thing we can take away from grubhub\u2019s positive earnings in 2018 is that profit margins in this industry are going to be SLIM at best until a new delivery paradigm such as autonomous drone delivery services and logistics can be profitably utilized. However, I will talk about those prospects shortly.\n4. **Financials:**\n   1. It is not new information knowing that DoorDash is a money incinerator. But just how much money is DASH losing every year? To give the an unbiased picture I am going to summarize  the positives and negatives of their financials\n   2. **The Positives:**\n      1. From 2018 to 2019 DASHs gross profit increased from just 63 million in 2018 to 362 million in 2019 showing a 574% YoY  increase. Their TTM gross profit in 2020 is estimated at 1.145 billion. This is a 316 % increase from their 2019 gross profit. Their overall revenue is also increasing as they posted a revenue of $291,000,000 in 2018, $885,000,000 in 2019, and a TTM estimated revenue of approximately $2.214B in 2020(the exact numbers will be made clear on their earnings which I talk about later)\n   3. **The Negatives:** \n      1. DASHs gross profit increases YoY seem to be bullish on the surface, but when you consider the fact that the black swan event, COVID 19, played a huge role in boosting their earnings this year it does not bode well for their future growth. The decreasing YoY profit percentage is not only indicative of growth and profit slowing as they expand their business, but their profit can be expected to decrease looking forward as the extended closings of restaurants due to COVID is creating a demand backlog for patronage for in house meals and services. \n      2. Also despite multiplying their gross profit five fold from 2018 and 2019 and three fold from 2019 to 2020, DASH still has no clear path to profitability as they posted net losses of 210 million in 2018, 616 million in 2019, and TTM losses of an estimated 268 million in 2020. \n      3. DASH spent an estimate of 270 million dollars on research and development from 2018 to September 30, 2020. But what is DASH, a non technological company researching and developing. NOTHING. DOOR DASH is actually most likely investing this money into OTHER companies that are developing the technology for autonomous and drone delivery, meaning that the increased revenue stream from subscribing, leasing, or buying drone and autonomous technologies from these companies must outweigh the prices they pay for them. Considering the logistics of fully autonomous drone delivery and the legislation surrounding such technologies, the fruits of these investments and developments may not be seen for the next 5-10 years at the EARLIEST.\n\n \n\n1. **Upcoming Earnings:** DASH is expected to post earnings on February 25, 2021 after market close. Their expected earnings are expected to be -0.75 cents per share.\n2. **Lock Up Expiry:** \n   1. Per their IPO, DOORDASH issued 33,000,000 class A common stock shares and raised approximately 3.27 Billion in proceeds after paying underwriting fees and commissions. Each share was offered at a price of 102 dollars per share. \n   2. This next bit is important: **Prior to the IPO there were 284,656,521 existing shares held by insiders.** The average price of those shares were $8.73. This means that even if the price is at $128 by March 9 which  is barely above the $127.50 share price needed for the early lock up expiry to be valid , insiders will be able to sell off their 20% shares at 1600% ROI. However this is not the full story.\n   3. 33,000,000 plus 284,656,521 will equal the total outstanding float of **317,656,521 shares.** \n   4. **The above outstanding float DOES NOT include the following**\n      1. 34,554,510 shares issuable upon the exercise of options to purchase class A common stock with an average exercise price of $2.41 per share. \n      2. 20,021,420 shares of class A common stock subject to RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) outstanding prior to September 30 2020\n      3. 14,003,990 shares of Class A common stock subject to RSUs granted AFTER September 30 2020 (10,379,000 of which are granted to the CEO Mr.Tony Xu, that vest when DASH hits certain stock price goals)\n      4. 105,330 shares of class A common stock issued upon the exercise of warrants (average price of $1.492 per share)\n      5. 39,722,785 shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under their equity compensation plans.\n      6. Totaling a whopping **108,408,035 possible more shares that can enter the float.** If we subtract the RSUs and  shares reserved for future issuance we get **34,659,840 shares that will enter the total outstanding float possibly in a short period** when stock options and warrants are exercised and redeemed for class A common stock.\n   5. **Conditions of the Lock Up Expiry**\n      1. such date is at least **90 days after December 9 2020**\n      2. such date occurs after they have  publicly furnished at least one earnings release on Form 8-K or filed at least one periodic report with the SEC\n      3. on such date, and for **5 out of any 10 consecutive trading days** ending on such date, the last reported closing price of our **Class A common stock is at least 25% greater than $102**\n      4. Such a date occurs in an open trading window and there are at least five trading days remaining in the open trading window.\n      5. WTF IS A TRADING WINDOW:\n      6. ANSWER: Trading windows are set in a company's insider trading policies. The SEC has no specific rules about the opening and closing of trading windows. These stipulations vary from company to company and can be found in each company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy document. In general, they typically open a couple days AFTER a big announcement or event like an earnings report or an acquisition or a declaration of bankruptcy etc. \n      7. I could not for the life of me find DASHs Insider Trading Policy but if we assume that their open trading window occurs on the second full day of trading after their earning report that would put the opening of the window on March 1 2020. Trading Window times can vary between 2 to 6 weeks long so their window will encompass the lock up expiry.\n      8. Also there is no need to rush or calculate the day of the lock up because **\u201cWe will announce both the Early Lock-Up Expiration Date and the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date through a press release or Form 8-K at least two full trading days before it is effective.\u201d** This is straight from the prospectus.\n   6. **Amount of new shares eligible for sale after lockup expiry**\n      1. 95,709,974 shares of Class A common stock held by former holders of their redeemable convertible preferred stock.\n      2. 6,262,890 shares of class A common stock held by members of their board of directors and members of their management team.\n      3. 11,889,744 shares of class A common stock held by all other holders.\n      4. Total number of new shares available for trading after early lock up: **113,862,608.** This means that **upon early lock up expiration, the amount of tradable shares on the open market will increase to 146,862,608 shares.** This is nearly 4.5 times the amount of shares that are currently trading on the market with **most of those shares being held by insiders,** **and early investors** looking to collect on their investment which will translate to **major selling volume.**\n3. **Competitors:** The biggest company that most reflects DASH is GrubHub. Uber is a car hailing service that tried to pass itself off as an emerging technology company that was developing autonomous driving technology but that has been shown to be a stretch of the imagination. However Uber still trades at about 8x sales multiple. GRUB trades at about 4x sales multiple. DASH is trading at 30x sales multiple. However, some justifications for this price are that DASH has higher market share than Uber or GRUB and deserve a premium for their dominance in industry but this just can not be true. Food commodity delivery is not an industry in which there is much differentiation. The leading factor for consumer choice over which app to open is entirely dependent on which company is offering the **cheapest price for delivery**. This includes the prices that restaurants have to pay in order to use their services. **DASH has some of the highest commission rates in the country for food delivery platforms**. If they cannot compete in this arena they will quickly lose market share to businesses that are willing to take lower commission for more traffic through their site. In an industry with hardly any real MOAT from any competitor, companies will devolve into a race to see who can remain solvent longer than another as commissions to restaurants and prices to consumers drops which will of course make these businesses even more unprofitable. \n4. **Price Target: Bearish/Conservative/Bullish:**\n   1. **Bearish:**\n      1. DASH begins to lose the race to the bottom as their highest in industry commissions to restaurants cause them to lose market share disproportionately. A bearish estimate of 3x sales would put DASH at about 6.5B market cap or $21 a share\n   2. **Conservative:**\n      1. DASH bites the bullet and begins slashing prices, which results in decreasing profitability but they maintain an even split of market share between big competitors putting them at the industry average of 5-6x sales multiple or 12B valuation for approximately $40 a share.\n   3. **Bullish:**\n      1. DASH stops paying 5 million dollars to advertise donating 1 million dollars to charity and starts thinking critically and regain market share by slashing research and development as they wait for other companies to invent drones for them since they clearly aren't going to do it themselves and slash prices harder than competitors to reclaim far greater market share. Having twice the market share of their competitors could put them at a generous 12x sales multiple or $24B valuation for a share price of $80 per share. \n5. **Positions:** I have been slowly building my positions in DASH beginning this past week and will continue to monitor the run up prior to earnings and take advantage of IV by selling ITM Call Credit Spreads and using a portion of that money to buy Far OTM puts. My current positions are 14 Call Credit Spreads 185/190 March 19 2021; 1x 160P May 21 2021; 4x 140P May 21 2021\n6. **Conclusion:** Major selling pressure upon the release of the shares after lock up as well as the 4 fold increase of  shares that will be tradeable on the float will contribute to heavy selling pressure. If the lock up does not occur that means the price is below 127.50 and I already reach max profit on the spreads and major gains on the puts. I will continue to add positions especially as it continues to touch the heavy resistance in the 220s.\n\n \n\n1. **Citations:** \n   1. **Revenue streams:** [**https://vator.tv/news/2018-10-05-how-does-doordash-make-money#:\\~:text=The%20company%20makes%20it%20money,order%20places%20through%20the%20platform.&text=The%20second%20revenue%20stream%20is,one%20coming%20from%20the%20restaurant**](https://vator.tv/news/2018-10-05-how-does-doordash-make-money#:~:text=The%20company%20makes%20it%20money,order%20places%20through%20the%20platform.&text=The%20second%20revenue%20stream%20is,one%20coming%20from%20the%20restaurant)**.**\n   2. **Finances:**\n      1. **yahoo-**[**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DASH/financials?p=DASH**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DASH/financials?p=DASH)\n      2. **Prospectus-** [**https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001792789/000119312520313884/d752207d424b4.htm#rom752207\\_3**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001792789/000119312520313884/d752207d424b4.htm#rom752207_3)\n   3. **Earnings Estimates:** [**https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dash/earnings**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dash/earnings)\n   4. **Grub hub Financials:** [**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRUB/financials?p=GRUB**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GRUB/financials?p=GRUB)\n   5. **Competitor Comparisons:** [**https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf**](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf)", "comments": [{"body": "My dude actually cited his sources this is WSB not your Fin101 class.", "created": 1613803629.0}, {"body": "working for doordash while buying puts on doordash :)", "created": 1613804838.0}, {"body": "Upvote just for citing sources.

SLABS have a really optimistic rating despite the increasing unemployment rate, inflation, and ZERO credit score from the students (most of the students who gets students loans doesn\u2019t even have a credit card or other credit instrument\u2026 which means that the student loan is the first credit in their lives without even having a credit background!)\n\n4- The underwriter from the SLABS are JPM, GS, DEUTCHE, MORGAN, ETC\u2026 same institutions that didn\u2019t give a fuck back in 2008.\n\n5- Biden student debt relief could be quite beneficial for the student debt ecosystem\u2026 which means that SLM and NAVI would be the ones most beneficed, increasing their stock price to the moon.\n\n6.

I'm getting sidetracked from my purpose here.\n\nIn order to make a claim that you know what you are investing in, you have to know how to pronounce the stock you believe in. Vuzix Corporation. VUZI ticker. That's not boo as in Voozie, it's view as in Viewzee. Viewzix. Vuzix. You know how to say it...so what is it? Oohh Oohh. Aahh Aahh.\n\nSmart glasses. You can think of Google glasses, but not a failure. Google glasses were a little ahead of themselves and Vuzix took the horns and hooked the market since late 2020. Please see the 6 Mth Chart of the stock prices and you'll see a pattern of announcements of agreements on almost every rise on the board. I'll list a few, but it's just as important to research some yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This man doesn't use RH\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^](https://preview.redd.it/14l9noqxcki61.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea0cee51dd19e5636b9f77d7fb9ce5b56047a873)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is augmented reality coming in to it's time. All you need to do is search Vuzix on any media box and you'll find the presentation that I will only speak of. I'm not good with visuals, but I'm good with seeing the vision and future of this technology and the grip that Vuzix is showing thru their continual raving reviews from wear house to med house usage, educational usage, remote training, sports training, etc.. This is real live results. The real shit. Not speculation. Hands free and micro view and whatever high tech jazz they throw in there that I can't speak of. Me have no chippie, but only banana.\n\nIs there competition? There is, but Vuzix has patents and proven model. The market itself is just now presenting itself back to the market. Every top search for augmented reality glasses will have Vuzix mentioned. They have stormed on to the scene since October really.\n\nYou say why would I invest in Vuzix if Google couldn't make it work with their augmented reality glasses? The answer is simple. They were a little ahead of themselves and now they are outpaced and outclassed. It's not those ugly things you didn't want to be caught wearing thing anymore. Covid changed the world and the type of augmented reality was coming anyways. Now it seems to have even more relevance and acceleration on the remote training aspect.\n\nBut if they didn't pass the mustard then, why would Vuzix pass the mustard now? Time has passed to get smaller chips and advance better visions, functions etc., Five G, Five G, and Five G. Micro chip advancements are a big help, and a company that knows why G Glasses wasn't a success seems to be proving itself on a regular basis.\n\nNobody wore those big ugly G glasses before, so why would they wear the VUZi glasses now? They have pretty good models for production forces and hands free work for sure. They are smaller and more productive than G's back in the short day ago. They don't look ugly, and the newer and upcoming models are going to blend in like regular shades. They already have pretty nice blending pairs now. Think of a smart phone thru your shades in the real near now.\n\nWith Five G. this has potential to expand to a very wide horizon of possibilities.\n\nImagine a doctor getting live vital readings on a critical patient from his desk, thru the eyes of the medic on the street. You think that won't save lives? Well this stock ain't for you then. This is already assisting in surgeries, and nursing care.\n\nHow does it effect everyday life and not just industries: I envision this taking to the next level with 5G and virtual shopping as you're walking down the streets of NEW YORK CITY. <<<<Let's get him. Any city that has a 5G net that we will all have. Sorry suburbanites, you may need to come to a town near you to get the real potential. I'm sure you can use them effectively staring in to the stars somehow too in the near future, so you might not be totally left out on the recreation side of these. These glasses will be the augmented directory as your walking down the streets. Need to know where to get those sour bumballs that you can never find anymore? Tearjerkers? Ya. Where the heck did you go? My pucker is worse that some the puckering I read on WSB. Only that gum can do it. Well I see the future where these glasses will show me where to go and how much they are without me having to look at my phone once. I can see purchases thru taps on glasses as well. Talk about premium contactless purchases and true window shopping. Step up to the shop window and get an augmented view of the contents. Go in if you want, order to have delivered if you don't want. We all know those drones will be following you home soon too. Might as well be bringing my goodies with it.\n\nOh yeah. Bullish drone stocks too.\n\nRecently I have felt some confirmation in my early entry to this stock. I know I don't have a ton in it, but I started with little only a few months ago. I'm going to keep investing and call striking and rolling into stocks on every win. This one has been a win the whole way in my portfolio. With I had a real YOLO on it, but i'm not done buying. either.\n\nCathie on that boat thingie just bought 290K Shares as well. She beat my DD, but that damn WSB rule is to blame.\n\nThe stock is at it's all time highs and it's only rating has it pegged at 30. This is the only initiation/rating I have seen to date. All announcements are usually agreements, sales, advances in industries etc., Take what you will. THis is not my estimate, but I can't disagree for the short term. I see a big buyout of some sort if it doesn't rocket all the way thru 2025+. I like the stock. I am not a professional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co9ix0nmdki61.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a6f046f16b87621d6054b0727d7204a83a60dfa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyif5itgdki61.png?width=1253&format=png&auto=webp&s=64fee9015b66ae7b88d679d9ff8f20a0a857350e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bte3dy8adki61.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=04981e933e4ddd744e916f8c6adb3aa39594c841\n\nThe speed is just now picking up in the augmented reality market. Vuzix is the leader in fashion, performance, and patent backed.\n\nIt's current Market cap of 1B is currently 1/100th of the TAM we will see in the next 5-6 years. Vuzi won't get it all, but a buyout from a big wig may be the only way they don't take most of it at this pace.\n\nTLDR: Vuzix (Viewzix}. VUZI ticker is going to be a huge factor in every day life once the 5G net is thrown all over the cities. Already assisting in Education, Remote Training, Surgery assist, Sport assist training and more.... The augmented reality is leaps and bounds what is was when the G company failed with G glasses. Now is the time and Vuzix is leading the pack to mordernize the look and performence. Bullish to the moon.

Its also been impossible to post about silver lately on WSB (no posts approved, thanks to the mod who assisted this one), so I crammed about 3-4 posts worth into this one.  Not sure when I'll be allowed to post again.\n\nI've organized this post into 4 sections so feel free to skip around to the parts you are interested in.\n\n1. The silver short squeeze evidence\n2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS\n3. The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed\n4. TLDR, what to buy if you want to go long silver\n\nSince my [initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6novm/the_real_dd_on_slv_the_worlds_biggest_short/) on the potential for a silver short squeeze, I have been researching the topic to prepare a more detailed and substantiated update post.  This is my latest attempt to post, and hopefully this one gets to stay up (silver censorship has been a thing here lately)\n\n**1.  The potential for a short squeeze (573% of the 'float' is currently sold short)**\n\nThe big thing to remember here is that if enough market participants who are long silver contracts in the futures market begin to demand delivery of their silver, there will absolutely be a meltup in the price  because there simply isn't enough supply available.\n\n**The next 3 trading days are critical, and there is war being waged.  The shorts and COMEX are in a fight for their lives, and barely hanging on by a thread**\n\nMany big name precious metals veterans have bemoaned for years about how the size of the 'paper' silver market absolutely dwarfs the amount of silver that could be delivered, and thus the market is manipulated.  The vast majority of futures and options contracts in the silver market have historically been settled via cash.  Meaning no physical silver is actually delivered when these contracts are set to expire. This is where the talk of the 100-1 and 250-1 paper silver to physical silver ratios comes from, but short interest is actually more like 6-1 on the COMEX using open interest data through the next two big delivery months.\n\nTechnically every month is eligible for deliveries, but only months with options interest tend to have any real volume, and that's why they are known as delivery months.  March and May are options expiration months, while April is not.\n\nIf you want to think about it like a stock, **the short interest is 573% of the 'float'**.  This is based on the fact that over the next 3 months there are futures contracts and options which have the right to take delivery of 847 million ounces of silver.  This is compared to only 147 million ounces registered on the COMEX that could fulfil these deliveries.  For perspective, GME short interest peaked at around 140% of its float, and that was considered crazy high.  It is widely known that if a small, but significant share of long silver contract holders took delivery, that there would not be enough silver, as the demand would cascade higher and higher as the prices rise.\n\n(sources: [silver stocks report](https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls),  [futures open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/volume-open-interest/metals-volume.html), [options open interest](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/open-interest-heatmap.html), data as of 2-18 was used in this post)\n\nThis would be similar to a bank run scenario.  The COMEX is the silver bank, and they have printed too many paper claims on a limited amount of silver.  If there is no actual silver left to be delivered to the holders of the futures contracts, that means that means that the COMEX would default and settle their contracts in cash.  No one wants to get settled in cash if the COMEX had to default.  This would mean that right as you want to be able to stay long silver, as the price is surging higher, that you will get forced out and paid cash instead of silver and wouldn't benefit from future increases in the price.  The traders who want to stay long silver and who see the run occurring would try to take delivery because if you actually have physical silver in your vault then it doesn't matter if the COMEX goes down, you still have your actual silver you can sell on the spot market.  Most importantly to them, they get to keep participating in the upside.\n\nNow the shorts are very much trying to keep the price down at the moment, because their problems get worse as the price rises and more options become in the money.  See the chart below, with a handy arrow to illustrate where we are currently in terms of March open interest.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6j90g954mi61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2ad9f33ea4008e3380ce11eb4e9333669e1524e\n\nAs the price rises more and more, the short interest grows as more options on futures contracts become 'in the money', compounding problems for the shorts. This is the silver version of a gamma squeeze.\n\nThe chart below shows the number of ounces that would be eligible for delivery over the next 3 months, given the current open interest data.  Most of the open interest comes from futures contracts that aren't dependent on price, but I've made this chart to illustrate how the problems get worse for the shorts due to the options contracts as the price rises.  The latest silver price as I'm writing this is $27.37.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t91qm4t84mi61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fee997ca32e24a60916e6829be375885263107c\n\nBut why would contract holders all of a sudden start to demand delivery when cash settlement has historically been the norm?  A couple of reasons.\n\nThe first reason is arbitrage.  Premiums on 1000oz bars have surged to somewhere between $1 and $2 an ounce (this is unheard of on the 1000oz commercial bars), meaning that traders can stand for delivery and then sell in the physical market for immediate profit.  When supply had become constrained in previous silver bull markets these premiums were more like 30 cents an ounce.\n\nIn addition, mints are also interested in arbitrage.  They could begin to take delivery to break down 1000oz commercial bars into smaller units which currently trade at historic premiums of $5-$8 an ounce.  The small unit silver market has experienced greater demand than ever before.  The entire stock of small unit silver was sold out at all dealers a few weeks ago.  The small amounts they do get in stock are only sold at massive premiums.\n\nThe second reason traders may take delivery is because they see the massive opportunity presenting itself right now, and they don't want to be cash settled when the COMEX defaults. They see that the squeeze is possible and that they profit massively by simply taking delivery, sitting on their silver while the squeeze happens, and then reselling it at much higher prices.  Early rumblings of massively increased delivery volume is already presenting itself in the data.  See the chart below showing the past 3 months of deliveries compared with the same time period in previous years\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise](https://preview.redd.it/5last6ye4mi61.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c7a2371c60c258e363183e693b1540647ea00c)\n\nNote that this chart corresponds with December of the previous year through February of the year that is labeled on the x-axis.  So 2016 actually represents December of 2015 through February of 2016.\n\nIt seems that the silver futures market is suddenly becoming a place where silver actually gets delivered in meaningful quantities.  This trend is even more pronounced when you look at just the most recent month of February, which like April was not an options expiration month, and thus typically has very low volume.  Even still, the increased interest in taking delivery of silver from the COMEX is very clear.   And historic at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\*Feb 2021 deliveries are ongoing and will continue to rise](https://preview.redd.it/pk37q11tkmi61.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddd64a50dfc58bf0f5a118951096f7dda5f5c69)\n\nFebruary 2021 has had 9.95 million ounces delivered through 2-18, and there is still 1.83 million ounces in open interest.  Anyone still sitting in a contract this late in the month wants delivery, so we can safely assume Feb. deliveries will end above 11 million, and closer to 12 million.   This is compared with an average of only 2.20 million ounces delivered in the previous 3 Februaries. An increase of roughly 422% (assuming 11.5 million delivered).\n\nMarch is gearing up to potentially be an earth shattering month for delivery requests that could send silver soaring.  March in the previous 3 years has averaged 26.79 million ounces delivered.  If this year's month of March experienced the same 422% increase in deliveries that occurred in February, that would represent \\~140 million ounces delivered.  Enough to completely drain the COMEX registered stocks.  If typical contract roll-forward behavior persists, we are actually on track to hit around that number.  The chart below shows how March is on track to finish the month with between 30-40k contracts demanding delivery (each contract represents 5,000 oz).  Chart is courtesy of  [u/Ditch\\_the\\_DeepState](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ditch_the_DeepState/) who does an awesome job with these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4013shwy4mi61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=69681cab0f800b559261aeeccedab93dc81cc7de\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Edit 2/20:** [u/Ditch\\_the\\_DeepState](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ditch_the_DeepState/) added a zoomed in version in his latest [post](https://new.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/lo35pt/the_silver_rush_on_comex_is_on_march_deliveries/) so I thought I'd add it here because it just looks so nice\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[note this has one more day of data relative to the chart above](https://preview.redd.it/ykkeebqflmi61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e85eed5a8056ce5025c92cf9fcaf6322ab72a36c)\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\nThe final day to roll contracts forward to not be eligible for March delivery is Wednesday, February 24th.  Given these are not normal times in terms of deliveries, it would not surprise me to see the decline for OI in March flatten out and stun the world by finishing with 40k contracts awaiting delivery.  The COMEX only has registered stocks to cover 29.4k.\n\nAnd let's say the COMEX survives March and is able to meet all the delivery requests, this is what the May open interest looks like. Can you imagine the COMEX going into May with only 20 or 30 million registered ounces staring down the barrel of 450+ million ounces of open interest (and this figure will rise once March passes and/or the price rise causes more call options to be ITM).  At this point the long in May would absolutely stand for delivery and hope they are one of the lucky few who aren't force settled in Cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5p95miq4mi61.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4163fc9c08e909d42207c5f2c4727c2ee0938f7\n\nSo even if only half or three-fourths of the 147 million available ounces are delivered, the May contract holders will see that the available supply is shrinking fast, creating even more demand for physical delivery because the opportunity is that much more clear for a continued short squeeze.  That and the fact that there are longs who really do want the silver for various reasons, and would be worried that the COMEX will default and there will be no silver available for delivery at all.\n\nThis is where critics of the potential for a short squeeze may point out that if the COMEX starts to run out of silver, they will just find more.  This is increasingly not an option however.  The primary stores of 1000oz bars are the LBMA vaults in London, and the COMEX.  When the COMEX starts experiencing high demand for gold or silver deliveries (typically due to the existence of premiums between paper and physical and a phenomenon known as backwardation), traders start chartering planes to deliver excess metal from the LBMA to the COMEX.  This occurred in March and April for gold and silver when physical started trading at premiums and traders began to demand delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2gvzf4m15mi61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=71b04f46a16a1d389f8e9946d38d2230fe215519\n\nThe problem with this line of thought is that nearly all of the silver in the LBMA is effectively allocated already.  The most common silver ETFs such as SLV use the LBMA silver vaults to allocate silver to their ETFs, and recent historic inflows to these ETFs has created a situation where the LBMA simply does not have unallocated supply that they will be able to ship to the COMEX.  Bullionstar.com recently ran an article showing that 85% of the silver in the LBMA was now held by silver ETFs that utilize the LBMA stores. This means that this Silver cannot be taken from the LBMA to reinforce the registered stocks of the COMEX.\n\nAlso notice how last spring/summer is when LBMA inventory (shown in green) dropped, which aligns with when the silver price surged and increased COMEX deliveries were happening (2020 was a record year for deliveries).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe LMBA is estimated to contain 1.08 billion ounces of silver.  Meaning that 162 million ounces aren't already allocated to ETFs.  Not known though, is how much of this 162 million ounces is owned by wealthy individuals and family offices who already have a claim to it.  Indeed, the supply situation at the LBMA is dire enough that the worlds largest silver ETF, SLV, had to change it's prospectus to mention that they may not be able to find silver to allocate to their ETF in the near future.  They made this change on 2/3 following historic inflows, but didn't make the document public until 2/8 for some reason.  Nor did they announce the change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67afe6635mi61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=29b4fc78fd4eee14341c3ccb571c9c89ff1cbdcb\n\nAnother decently sized silver ETF that I can't mention also changed their prospectus and directly mentioned that there might be a short squeeze and actually seems to sympathize with the hedge funds who would potentially be 'hurt' in the process\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pir687z35mi61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=930a7ce3557ea2ac00a110d4dc6902cf4fb1c652\n\nSo why did JPM feel the need to [downgrade silver](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/miners-tumble-as-jpmorgan-downgrades-sector-and-silver-prices-slide-from-eight-year-high-11612259966) just as it started to spike, why did the CFTC feel the need to [raise margin requirements](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/cme-raises-comex-silver-futures-margins-by-18-effective-feb-2) the very same day, and why did Goldman feel the [need to publish an article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/goldman-sachs-says-it-would-be-impossible-for-retail-traders-to-short-squeeze-silver.html) saying the squeeze was impossible, also on the same day?  They are terrified the squeeze of the naked shorts in the silver market might actually happen.  Just as the ETFs are now warning in their prospectuses.\n\nThe report from Goldman made the ludicrous claim that each member of WSB would need to purchase 4,200 ounces of silver to cause a squeeze.  Assuming approximately 8 million members at the time, that's roughly 33.6 billion ounces of silver, and at $27.37 an ounce, would represent $920 billion worth of silver.\n\nThere is a myth that the silver market is as large as $1.5 trillion in total, which is probably where Jeff Currie from Goldman somehow came up with this $920 billion figure.  This is a vast overstatement of the available investment grade silver.  These figures represent the grand total of all silver that has ever been mined in the history of the world. The overwhelming majority of this silver has been used in the production of various electronics, medical devices, and other products and simply cannot be recovered (20oz of silver are used in every electric vehicle btw).  Maybe at $500 an ounce, dumps will begin to look for phones and other electronics and try to chemically separate the miniscule amounts of silver from each device, but at $27 an ounce this is completely unrealistic.  Even then, it would be a minimum 6 months to get silver recycled from these devices and into the 1000oz bar format that is required for the futures market.\n\nIf you look at various sources (google it), most of them estimate the entire quantity of investable silver in the world is somewhere between 2.8 and 4 billion ounces if you include the small denominations of silver (which can't be used to deliver on the COMEX).  Using the high end estimate at 4 billion ounces, this would mean the entire investment grade silver market is only valued at $109 billion. The futures market only deals with 1000oz bars of which there is estimated to only be 2 billion ounces worth.\n\n**There are only 0.36 to 0.52 investment grade ounces of silver per person in the world if you include both the small denominations and the 1000oz bars together. At $27.37 an ounce this is only $9.85 to $14.23 worth of investment grade silver per person.**  Go take a stroll through some of the silver forums on reddit and you'll see people are buying 6 figures worth regularly right now.\n\nThe allocated *and* unallocated silver in the LBMA and COMEX in total is roughly 1.5 billion ounces, which is a far cry from the 33.6 billion that Goldman is referring to.  As I have mentioned, most of this 1.5 billion ounces is already allocated to owners as well.\n\nThink about 2 billion ounces worth of silver in 1000oz format. That is a tiny, tiny number.  At current prices it represents $55 billion.  There are only 2 million 1000oz bars, and each one costs roughly $27,710.\n\n**There is another asset that has been in the news recently that is over 55k in price (WSB bans mentioning it, I'm not trying to pump it, just use it for an example).  There are only \\~21 million of these items that will ever be mined, and they are valued for their scarcity and deflationary tendency.  For every ten of these** ***things which shall not be named*** **there is only** ***one*** **1000oz commercial silver bar, and each bar costs roughly half of what 1 of the** ***things that shall not be named*** **costs.**\n\nTo say that silver could not have an epic surge in the same way, despite being 10x more scarce, and half the price at that, is ludicrous. Silver is used in production of actual real things and the supply over a long enough period will actually be entirely exhausted unless we figure out how to economically mine asteroids (which would only be economical at silver prices far beyond what's ever been achieved).\n\nAs part of my research for this post I was actually able to get in touch with silver industry veteran, David Morgan (thanks for answering a random guy's twitter DM David).  He told me an anecdote from back in the previous run-up during 2010-11 where he had a conversation with Eric Sprott who mentioned that Sprott Inc's purchase of just 22 million commercial ounces to start their ETF of PSLV was enough to drive up the price by over $2 an ounce.  Unlike the other silver ETFs which just allocate silver off of the LBMA, PSLV actually sources silver in the open market to add to their vaults, which is why investing in PSLV can actually cause the silver price to rise much more directly than the other ETFs.\n\nSo who is on the other side of this trade? Banks and large hedge funds, who are massively [net short silver](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/BankParticipationReports/deajan21f), to the tune of 91,468 contracts sold short compared with only 16,071 contracts long.  The banks are trying to make sure the price stays low so that they can discourage run ups in the price that would create a short squeeze (and cause them to experience massive losses on their naked short positions).\n\nIf you want more proof that these markets are historically manipulated look at the fines [JPM had to pay recently](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty/jpmorgan-to-pay-920-million-for-manipulating-precious-metals-treasury-market-idUSKBN26K325).  Which brings me to part 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2. Why the 'hedge funds are pushing silver' narrative is BS**\n\nSeveral posts have documented the timeline of Silver posts on WSB and why the narrative of hedge funds pushing silver to hurt GME doesn't really make sense.\n\nHere's a couple of them that I personally liked (and there are many more): [one from u/johnnycleveland](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lemo97/how_reports_in_the_media_claiming_that_reddit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [another from u/blipblopbloop11](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/lhqk6p/100_proof_the_antisilver_movement_in_wsb_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nBesides the fact that many on WSB were fans of silver long before the GME craze (including myself), banks have a massive net short position in silver (which I cover later in this post).  At the time the anti-silver post went viral about Citadel having a large position in SLV, it comprised only 0.04% of their AUM, and they actually had **3 times this amount, 0.13% of AUM, in** ***PUTS*** **ON SLV.**  [Proof](https://imgur.com/gallery/2Kw2Bac).  So it doesn't make sense for them to try and stop one short squeeze that hurts them by causing a second short squeeze that would also hurt them.\n\nI'm not sure if hedge fund bots were actually driving the anti-silver propaganda, or if it just caught on because people wanted a scapegoat for the GME losses, but either way it seems like silver was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The people investing in silver, and the people investing in GME are natural allies.  Its a mix of a desire for tendies and giving big banks and hedge funds the finger.\n\nWhy weren't AMC, BB, NOK, weed stocks, and many other popular positions not considered distractions from GME?  Wouldn't GME have gone much higher if everyone on WSB had stuck to only GME and not these other plays?\n\n**There was absolutely institutional collusion to prevent GME from getting the infinity squeeze it was set up to get.**  The interactive brokers CEO even said on live TV that \"the price was headed to infinity\" if they hadn't stepped in to \"stop the losses\".\n\nThis collusion is simply unrelated to the fact that some of us on WSB also like the silver market setup.  I totally agree that media reports of WSB 'moving to silver' were somewhat poorly worded.  Just as the reports of WSB moving to weed stocks were poorly worded.  Some people on WSB are playing silver, some are playing weed stocks, but these headlines make it sound like it's everyone when it's never true that all of WSB is long a single trade (GME may have been close though).  I understand frustration about poor reporting.  Please don't take it out on your fellow WSB apes though.\n\nAnd if you are still holding GME and think it can squeeze again, I respect that and I still hope it goes to $1,000 and higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3.  The fundamental case for silver, and why the shorts deserve to be squeezed**\n\nFirst of all, as previously mentioned, the short side of the equation is almost entirely made up of banks and hedge funds, so keep that in mind when you might have sympathy for the shorts here.\n\nSecond, the demonetization of silver was used as a blunt instrument to impoverish the populace, and enrich the wealthy and bankers all the way back in 1873.  We know that wealth is generational, so if you had family living in the United States prior to 1873, and they were not wealthy, it is highly likely that they were massively impoverished by banker related corruption at the time.  Here's a quick rundown of what happened:\n\nOriginally both gold and silver were considered legal tender in the United States.\n\nThe monetary base was roughly half comprised of gold and half comprised of silver, with a fixed exchange rate of 15 ounces of silver to one ounce of gold.  Because silver was more common, it was considered the common currency of exchange with gold only being used by the wealthy in large transactions.\n\nIn 1873 a bill was signed to demonetize silver, while keeping gold as legal tender.\n\nAll of the common people had their savings in silver which became increasingly worth less relative to gold, while all of the wealthy had their savings in gold, so the value of their savings appreciated.\n\nIn line with the removal of 50% of the monetary base, we experienced roughly 50% deflation over the next few decades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sjruwxd65mi61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=16da0a23620806a1d4722ff4eb9916837a67be60\n\nAlong with this deflation though, the value of debt also rose.  So if you were poor, and also likely indebted, with one stroke of a pen your money began to become worthless while at the same time your debt became progressively worth more due to deflation.  If you were a wealthy gold owner, or a bank, you likely owned that debt that became worth more alongside the gold you already held.  A double win for the wealthy, and a double hit for the poor.  One stroke of a pen created generational wealth for some, and generational poverty for others.\n\n**Yet another reason squeezing silver, with banks on the other side of the trade would be true cosmic justice.**\n\nFundamentally, there are plenty of reasons why silver demand long term will rise.  On the industrial demand side, silver is used in solar panels, electric vehicles, other electronics of all kinds, and expensive space related items, where getting 100% electricity conduction is worth it compared with the second best metal of copper at 97%.  These industries are expected to grow quickly in the next decade and more silver will be needed for this reason.\n\nMonetarily, the money supply is expanding at historic rates and most of the 'smartest people in the room' are calling for higher inflation in the next few years.  Pretty much every commodity except gold and silver have been on an absolute tear the last few months and they are breaking out into what most consider multi-year bull market cycles.  This will drive inflation even further.\n\nSilver is more common than gold but spread rather thin in the earth's crust so it isn't mined directly in large quantities.  It's more typically a byproduct of mining for other raw materials. The lack of dedicated silver mines means that silver today is mined at only an 8-1 ratio to gold despite naturally occurring at roughly 18.75-1 ratio.  Silver is currently trading at a 66-1 ratio to gold, and gold hasn't even been rising lately.  In the 2010-2011 run we got down to a 30-1 ratio, and if people begin to worry about inflation and consider silver a monetary hedge, there's nothing stopping silver from getting to its natural ratio of 18.75-1 or even lower considering the industrial demand combined with the lower 8-1 production ratio.\n\nThese lower ratios combined with higher gold prices in the future mean that silver can realistically get above $50 in short order, possibly even above $100, and if you think the monetary system is really headed downhill, even up to the outrageous forecasts of $500+ from the likes of Patrick Karim on twitter.  Note that Patrick posts various charts all the time and his most recent forecast is $182 silver by 2023. Love your charts Patrick (give this man a follow).\n\nIn terms of timing this thing, look at the only other 3 times silver went into backwardation in the past decade (we've just entered the 4th time). Every single time it had a powerful rally afterwards, because it means that physical supply is constrained in the short run, and the shorts are trying to pay longs to get out of their contracts. And those other 3 times didn't have a true chance of COMEX default like this time does, supply/demand has never been this imbalanced and the premiums in the physical market are proof of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmsp3tc63mi61.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa320bc6ee62d7067ab42a45a381f79139303906\n\n**In the end, the goal of buying silver should be to make tendies and to end the manipulation of these markets. We need to get to the point where entering into a contract to sell silver means you actually have the physical silver to sell.  No more naked shorting and profiteering off the little people. An honest silver market is the ultimate goal here.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4. TLDR, what to buy**\n\nTo get the most secure, best value for your dollar in terms of silver I would personally prioritize purchases in the following order (others may prioritize differently and that's ok):\n\n1. Take delivery on the futures market if you are able (no premiums, but only available to large players)\n2. Purchase shares of the PSLV ETF who will then purchase 1000oz bars\n3. Purchase 1000oz bars at retail if you can find them for reasonable premiums\n4. Purchase smaller units of silver if the premiums come down to 15% or less.  There are roughly 1-2 billion ounces of small unit silver in the world that don't directly impact the 1000oz bar market, but demand for them does cause premiums to soar, which can then cause mints to purchase 1000oz bars to smelt into smaller pieces. This is also the preferred option for those who are concerned with the total collapse of the fiat monetary system and other doomsday scenarios.  Personally I'm just wanting honest markets and to make tendies which is why this ranks 4th on my list.\n5. Purchase other silver ETFs such as SLV.  Purchasing these will at least theoretically take silver off of the LBMA, but recent disclosures from these ETFs are making them seem less trustworthy (note that there is no definitive proof of any kind of fraud from these ETFs)\n6. Riskier Alternatives:  Purchasing shares of silver miners, calls on silver miners, and even calls on the other silver ETFs are all riskier bets and potentially more profitable short term.  This is likely what many here at WSB are going to do\n\nDisclosure: I am long silver miners and silver ETFs at this time\n\nAlso disclosure: make your own choices, we are all individuals, this is my personal take on the silver market and it includes plenty of speculation and opinion.  Treat this post as just that, some random guy's opinion on the internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:** To the people saying this 'looks fishy' because of the comment to upvote ratio or award to upvote ratio, its only that way because of the people exactly like yourself who auto-downvote anything related to silver, and really anything not GME.  If this post had the same upvote ratio as my original post 3 weeks ago I'd legitimately have 5-10x the upvotes right now. And this post is far better and more deserving than my original one was.  Its a self-fulfilling prophecy over here where a noob sees a non-GME post, downvotes it without reading, OG WSBers see a well thought out DD and give upvotes and awards, then more cultists come along and say it looks fishy. Try reading the post first!\n\nYou know what is super fishy?  The fact that the WSB mod coup attempt occurred right when the anti-silver propaganda blew up and silver posts were banned after that as well.  Ask yourself who was in charge when silver censorship started and you'll realize what is actually fishy here.\n\n&#x200B;", "comments": [{"body": "This is the first book ive ever read.", "created": 1613799679.0}, {"body": "i know some of these words", "created": 1613796504.0}, {"body": "Can I buy silver at GameStop?", "created": 1613798926.0}, {"body": "Show us your position", "created": 1613796390.0}, {"body": "Impressive work, don't think anyone can argue that paper silver hasn't been manipulated and suppressed for a very long time.", "created": 1613796709.0}], "created": 1613796136.0}, {"title": "$KAR Auction Services still has covid and sucks badly", "text": "Why would you, a retard, care if this company caught covid-19 and stock price dropped to half price?  \n\nAs you  scroll past the densest paragraphs of this dd you may realize this 'company' has terrible reviews.

Phil Town first presented these steps in his book \"Rule#1\"\n\nAccording to Phil, a company is predictable when it has\\*\\*: \n\n* 10-Year median ROIC (%) > 10%. \n* 10-Year median Revenue growth rate > 10%.\n* 10-Year median EPS growth rate > 10%. \n* 10-Year median Book (equity) growth rate > 10%\n* 10-Year median FCF growth rate > 10%\n\n*There are only 44 companies trading in the US that satisfy these requirements.*\n\nLet's now calculate their fair value assuming a 15% return per year for the next 10 years. \n\nThis is done by following the steps below\\*\\*\\*:\n\n1. Get the 10-Year Book growth rate\n2. Get the current EPS\n3. Grow the current EPS at the 10-Year Book growth rate, for 10 years\n4. Calculate the PE ratio in 10 years by doubling the 10-Year book growth ratio\n5. Multiply the EPS in 10 years by the PE in 10 years to obtain the future market price\n6. Discount the future market price so that it will give you 15% return for the next 10 years.\n\nI know we are all retards so apologies for being testing the limit of our brainpower with these calculations.\n\nI personally modified Step 1 and 6 to be more conservative. For Step 1) I consider the minimum between the 10-Year Book growth rate and 10-Year EPS without NRI Growth Rate, for Step 4) I consider the minimum between the double of the 10-Year Book growth ratio and the 10-Year median PE Ratio without NRI. \n\nStep 6) gives us what Phil calls the \"Sticker Price\" which is the price the company should be selling right now, to give a 15% return a year for the next 10 years. But because things don't always go as planned, as they didn't for your marriage, we divide the Sticker Price by a Margin of safety (MoS). Phil likes to use 50%, I personally use 30% because I am more conservative when I calculate the Sticker Price.\n\n***There are only 4 companies*** **that would give us at least 15% return for the next 10 years, with a MoS of 30%, and these are: CACC, EPAM, NOAH and TPL.** \n\nNOAH and TPL are the most undervalued and they could produce a 30% return a year for the next 10 years if they don't fuck things up! \n\nThat's all.\n\nIf you want, I uploaded my spreadsheet here: [https://easyupload.io/zvjhi6](https://easyupload.io/zvjhi6)  \\- password: yourwifesname\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\*I've used [https://www.gurufocus.com/screener](https://www.gurufocus.com/screener)\n\n\\*\\*Phil uses these numbers because they tell us that the company has been growing, constantly, at a good and sustainable pace and has used well its capital, for the past 10 years. Can we be sure that it will keep doing so in the future? No! That's why we use a Margin of Safety.\n\n\\*\\*\\*EXAMPLE using CACC (data from the 01/01/2021).([https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CACC/summary](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/CACC/summary)) \n\nToday, CACC closed at $366.07. The 10-Year Book growth rate, which gives us an idea of how much the company could keep growing each year, for the next 10 years, is 23.9%. As I said above I personally consider the minimum between the 10-Year Book growth rate (23.9%) and 10-Year EPS without NRI Growth Rate (22.1%). Then we grow the current EPS at that rate (22.1%). \n\nThe current EPS is $22.95, if I grow this at 22.1% a year for 10 years I get an EPS in 10 years of $169.02. \n\nTo get the price in 10 years I need the PE ratio in 10 years. Phil uses double the 10-Year Book growth rate, so if we had 23.9%, he would use a PE ratio of 47.8. I use the minimum between the double of the 10-Year Book growth ratio and the 10-Year median PE Ratio without NRI so in this case 44.2\n\nOnce we have the EPS in 10 years ad the PE ratio in 10 years, we can get the price of the company in 10 years by doing (P/E) \\* EPS = P. In this case 44.2\\*169.02 = $2143.18  \nWe get this price and we discount it back to today, assuming a 15% return a year. Like this we get the Sticker Price which is the price at which the share should sell to give us a 15% return a year for the next 10 years. In this example this would be $529.76.\n\nWe then apply a Margin of Safety (Phil uses 50%, I use 30%) to 529.76, you get the entry price of $370.83. We are just below that ;)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor.

The only cost is a small bit of margin needed to hold the position for each put sold ($50).\n\nOn the option chain expiring the first week in March, the trade is to sell one put at the 5.50 strike, buy one put at the 5.00 strike and two at the 4.50 strike (ratio backspread basically). I was able to put on this position for a $0.03 credit. Surprising, since I thought OOTM puts would be higher priced going into earnings. You CAN do this with puts expiring next week, but there's almost no time for the trade to develop post-earnings. \n\nSo how does this trade work?\n\n$AMC blows out earnings: Moonshot, short squeeze and the hedged put position expires worthless (you get to keep the small credit). Nothing lost and tendies for all.\n\n$AMC stays stagnant: Position will likely expire worthless, but 5.50 puts could either be closed for cheap or if the stock dips into the 5.50 range, you'll own shares at that price. Not too bad. This is probably the worst scenario.\n\n$AMC tanks: Sell the whole position for a profit, offsetting (paper) losses from the stock. OR sell the long puts and take possession of the shares via assignment of the short put at a cost of 5.50 per share (read: don't waste money covering the short put!). I mean, you WANT more shares anyway for the eventual squeeze. This kills two birds with one stone.\n\nFor me, I'm holding 700 AMC shares and I'm holding 15 of the above ratio spreads (short 15 5.50 puts, long 15 5.00 puts, long 30 4.50 puts). I may add to both, depending on how the market behaves.\n\nGood luck with earnings next week. And thank you for this great subreddit!", "comments": [{"body": "Stock is unlikely to stay in range.

However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.\n\nSo, what is the true short interest then?\n\nWell, let\u2019s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:\n\nInsider Ownership: 23,704,787\n\nInstitutions: 151,000,000\n\nFunds: 40,000,000\n\nRetail: 38,595,000\n\nTotal Owned: 253,299,787\n\nTotal Outstanding: 69,746,960\n\nPercentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%\n\nEstimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827\n\nFINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%\n\nFinviz Float: 50,650,000\n\nReported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624\n\nTotal Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)\n\n219,091,451\n\nPercentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%\n\nIf you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024\u2019s data, check out his DD.\n\n***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \\~432.56%.***\n\nLast week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME\u2019s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***\n\nNow, I know, lol.

Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.\n\nWe are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.\n\nSo, continue to hold fellow apes.

They're lobbying to get more stim $$$ to distressed movie theaters. Lemme summarize what I learned, and also **explain why all this is bullish for AMC.**\n\n**1) What did NATO do?**\n\n\\-They successfully lobbied for a $15-billion relief package for indie movie theaters that have suffered a greater than 25% revenue loss. This bill, unfortunately doesn't cover AMC, Regal, and Cinemark.\n\n\\-However, NATO lobbied to give tax credits for the aforementioned bigger theaters. This might not sound like a lot, but the tax credit was the only thing that allowed TSLA to have profitable quarters prior to last year. \n\n\\-Also, all theater workers (including at AMC), will have unemployment benefits extended nationwide.\n\n\\-As if that's not enough, NATO is continuing to lobby for bigger companies like AMC to receive stimulus money.   \n\n\n**2) Will Streaming Kill theaters after the re-open?**  \n\\-This seams to be the #1 concern amongst WSBers and reddit people across different subs. Well, I have a great answer for you: NO.\n\n\\-NATO, AMC, Regal, Cinemark  worked out deals with most of the major studios to NOT simultaneously release films online with their theatrical releases post-covid. Theatrical box office windows (and their revenues) will therefore be protected once we officially re-open America.  \n\n\n**3) Consolidation:**\n\n\\-Several thousand least-performing theaters have already shut down. This, for better and worse, will help AMC. NATO actually finds this to be a good by-product of covid, as underperforming theaters have been wasteful for movies that screened in them. It's very likely that AMC and or Regal will buy them out and renovate those theaters.   \n\n\n4**) Pent-up Demand:**\n\n\\-Japan and China have reopened their theaters. Both have had RECORD box office numbers with domestic movies that typically don't beat tentpoles like The Avengers or Batman, etc.   \n\n\n**5) Unprecedented Pipeline:**\n\nIt's ultimately all about the movies. Will the be good, and will you see them?  \nI'm pleased to say, 2021 and 2022 will be INSANE. \n\nNormally, you might have one or two big event movies a year. After March, we have like 1 or 2 tentpole releases every month this year, including but not limited to:  \nGodzilla Vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Cruella, F9, Uncharted (the movie), Venom sequel, Spider-man sequel, Conjuring sequel, Top Gun sequel, Space Jam (with LBJ), James Bond, Resident Evil and many auteur driven lower budget films by PT Anderson, David Fincher, and Wes Anderson.   \n\n\n**6) Theaters found more ways to make money:**\n\n\\-Also, the closure of the theaters was an opportunity for the bigger theater chains to improve and re-model their outdated systems. \n\n\\-Many rear-projection screens (that require projectionists and expensive projectors) are being replaced by LED screens. \n\n\\-Sound systems are being dramatically improved. \n\n\\-The seats will have tables, suitable for the service of Wine, Beer, and Meals.  \n\n\n**7) The Craziest (and likely) Scenario:**\n\n\\-The Paramount Consent Decrees are being repealed. This decree basically prevented one company from producing and exhibiting films. \n\n\\-NATO is now in talks with Apple, Amazon, and Netflix to screen content in movie theaters.   \nNetflix has already bought a number of independent theaters. \n\n\\-There are rumors about AAPL or AMZN acquiring AMC!  John didn't deny those rumors.  \n\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Stimulus has lagged in helping the movie theaters because they were deemed \"non-essential,\" but not anymore. Money's on the way. Also, after we re-open, we'll have one of the most ridiculously popular films released all at once for the next two years, in protected viewing windows in which theaters will not compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon. On the contrary, Amazon or Apple might acquire theater companies, like AMC and Regal due to the repeal of the Paramount Consent Decrees.   \n\n\nNot financial advice, but I see some rockets and moons.   \n\n\nAMC \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "comments": [{"body": "I think AMC is fucked.

I found myself placing stupid bets right after making money on the ones that I carefully planned the day before when I was not influenced by the app. Some executives at Facebook and other social networks don't use their own products because they know they are designed to be addictive.

Its platform includes device security, privacy and safe Wi-Fi, online protection, and identity protection, creating a seamless and integrated digital moat. For enterprises and governments, it offers a comprehensive cybersecurity solution that protects its customers against adversarial threats across cloud, on-premise, hybrid environments and endpoint devices. It operates in two business segments namely Consumer and Enterprise. \n\nMcAfee (MCFE) IPO'd quietly towards the end of 2020 and was lost in the hype of PLTR and many other public companies.

Organizations were forced to migrate to cloud computing-based operations like never before, so there was huge demand for services from companies like Crowdstrike Holdings, Zscaler, and Octa, and prices for all three stocks increased by triple digit-percentages last year as a result. \u00a0McAfee is also a force to be reckoned with in the enterprise security market, where it counts 78% of the Fortune 500\u00a0 and 86% of the Global 2000 as customers. The company\u2019s Mvision enterprise product portfolio\u00a0provides tools for protecting employee devices from hacking attempts. It also includes a growing lineup of solutions\u00a0for securing backend assets such as public cloud deployments and workloads deployed in containers. \n\nMcAfee is expected to post 2.81 Billion dollars in revenue for the 2020 year, and earn a positive net income for the first time.

The big next step is - can they get EBITDA positive? They've already turned around their operating cash flow so...\n\n**TLDR:** $SE is in a wedge touching resistance lines of ~282.

You might remember me from such hits as knowing exactly where each GME weekly was going to end up, getting people out of SNDL before it collapsed, and starting a $RIOT before it was cool, warning you to get out of PLTR at 39, amongst others.  Today I want to have a more...gentle...conversation with you.  Let's talk about cruise stonks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Wayne's World Flashback Humming\n\nPicture it:  It's 2020.  The air is crisp with winter in the air, you're blowing your student loans on the latest iPhone, and your parents have decided to spend some of your inheritance on a 10 day Caribbean cruise because they're tired of shoveling snow, and you ended up being their greatest disappointment, anyways so why should they leave you some money?  So you could go blow it all on some SPY FD puts?  Screw that.  Carnival ($CCL) was sitting at about $42 a share, $NCLH was at $52, $RCL at $115.  Everything in the world was in its place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen mom and dad called you frantically to let you know that there was a bioattack upon the ship, originating somewhere around the shuffleboard area.  Everybody was dying and the army wasn't letting them off the ship.  They wanted to let you know that they loved you...but that they, too, had been buying SPY FD puts and had lost the rest of your inheritance and were waiting for the right time to tell you.  Things were looking really grim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we all know, predictably, when the world shut down, the cruise stonks got positively crushed.  Turns out having $0 in revenue is bad for stonk price.  Who knew?  But should they stay there?  Is there no longer a business model for beyond-middle-aged white people that want to spend a couple of weeks pretending they're \"alive\" as they partake in an entirely on-the-rails kiddie bumper adventure?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Back to the present\n\nAdvance bookings say otherwise as Boomers make a recreational bet on \"return to normal\".  Take Norwegian, for example:  They're advance bookings for 2021 is actually \\*ahead of\\* where they were in 2019 in spite of extending their global sailing boycott all the way to \\*\\*next May\\*\\*.  Royal Caribbean and Carnival both state that their 2021 bookings are back to exactly on par where they were before all this madness about spicy flu happened.  And these are just the people who are willing to fork over money right now that AREN'T afraid of the scamdem...oops, I mean...well...you know.  Just wait until everybody gets emboldened by their plot armo...I mean vaccinations.  More tellingly, the vast majority of people who were booked on canceled cruises, when given the choice between refunds or rollovers, chose rollovers.  Dumb move since money now is better than money later, but just another sign that we're all in a virtual simulation of Idiocracy.  Run with it.  Now add in the fact that, as we open up, people will be positively DESPERATE to go do something - ANYTHING - that's not in their house that they will positively crush any and all entertainment options - especially travel.  So, in a way, this DD could actually apply to stonks like Cedar & Six Flags or Disney or...whoever sells \"fun\", depending on what your definition of that is.  Thanks to the K-shaped recovery, most people in this country are sitting on a pile of extra cash they're just waiting to blow on an enhanced vacation package of some sort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut let's look under the hood for a moment, shall we?  The reason these 3 lines were able to stave off bankruptcy is threefold:  1, they all raised debt to create liquidity. That's generally bad, but since the Fed has been a free money printing machine for a while, they got some fantastic interest rates for that debt.  Matter of fact, 2 of the 3 of them used that new debt to pay off older, higher interest debt, then took out new new debt to make up the difference.  2, they all issued shares and created a small amount of dilution (though, in the case of Carnival, they were in the middle of a stock buyback when this all happened, so they basically ended up re-issuing the shares they had bought.  Bad for short term balance sheets, but long term lesser impact), and 3, they've been locked out of COVID related relief packages till now, which means their turn in the queue is widely viewed as coming up for their shot at free money roulette.  At present, it's looking like about a quarter billion dollars to them to bail them out.  They've already been able to shift their portage losses directly to the ports in question, so they saved some cash there, as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, using some napkin math and Yamazaki logic, the only thing preventing these cruise lines from going right back to where they were before all this happened is if they find themselves in a credit crunch, as the data shows that they will return to normal capacity operations in time.  So let's take a look at cash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cash on hand for stonks](https://preview.redd.it/qije4vzf9ii61.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a7e7ffcc159e13c3971582f68aaef1147140f0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the chart above, I took the liberty of adding $CUK, which is Carnival's \"other\" stonk.  Really, understanding this group, I guess I should have listed that one as the primary so you feel more comfortable about it as you listen to your wife get railed by her boyfriend.  But I digress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOK, so how much are they burning?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Moneys](https://preview.redd.it/tn4v6mfc9ii61.png?width=532&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f48de1c580e73a8819c42a2ac98473967f98547)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, all you know exactly what this looks like - nobody knows better than WSB how to look at loss porn, and these cruise lines have a lot of it.  The gist here is that Carnival and Norwegian are probably fine financially for at least another year with no new income (and they have debt they haven't accessed yet at their disposal).  Royal Caribbean is in a little bit of a tighter spot, as they're going to have to go to the banks for money in the next 6 months barring a government bailout.  Norwegian is in a particularly envious position, because their debt levels are already lower than everybody else's and some of their smaller subsidiaries are going to be setting sail on those river cruises earlier, which will staunch their bleeding as Europe re-opens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, because I know all you retards love talking about shorts and what not, let's take a look at what Wall Street thinks of these stonks.  If they're going bankrupt, they're going to lean their chipstack in on them, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short interest](https://preview.redd.it/bi02h0nh9ii61.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=546fbe39e030495537a45c4ac3424c656dcb8e02)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey don't seem to be betting on them to fail.  Hmm.\n\nLet's take a look at volume\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[30 day average volume](https://preview.redd.it/tzxgbxoj9ii61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=863ef277ecf23919b78f09c3f0e0af2d440d53ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe smart money started piling in just before Christmas.  That's about when I got in on 2 of these, as well.  But I felt it was an aggressive move at the time.  Especially since we were missing a lot of vaccination data as well as any forward guidance from these companies.  They've since clarified their stance, and the vaccination data shows that we were already going to be rolling out a million doses a day, in spite of what one side of the aisle was claiming the mango was going to deliver on.  Volume tapered off to normal levels since then, but has since started picking up on the upbeat news that should have effect on this particular industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOutlook:  I'm incredibly bullish on $NCLH.  I'm highly bullish on $CCL.  $RCL is a little more problematic to me, looking at the total picture, and I'm pretty neutral on them overall, bordering on skeptical.\n\nI had more I wanted to talk about, but I'm tired of typing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So, To summarize:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Your Boomer parents are going to start getting on these boats again as soon as they start floating\n* Unlike last time (and thanks to the K-shaped recovery), they'll very likely splurge on the shore activity packages rather than cheap out and sit by the pool at every port this time since they have extra money to burn\n* None of these companies are facing imminent financial threat, and have not only secured solid credit lines and nice reserves to weather this storm without sinking  (get it?  Hah), but actually showed their financial houses were pretty tight\n* They've always been reliable earners, and will continue to be as they ramp back up.  This is a rare opportunity to get what is usually a slow moving Boomer stonk at a steep discount\n* In the future, they'll actually be able to make MORE money because they had COVID as an excuse to suspend dividends, and don't think for a second they're going to be in a rush to bring those back even after shit returns to normal\n* Your grandparents still don't love you either\n* Buy a cruise ticket and you'll be sad, but you'll have enough money to where you'll be able to find some 45 year old who's a bit on the brown side of ripe that mistakenly thought they were going to be Stella and get their groove back with some strapping Jamaican native, who nonetheless will be impressed by your stack of tendies and will probably still give you blowies as you try to reach down to get to the base of her sagging tiddies\n* Also invest in some pharma plays for the inevitable increase in senior citizen STD's that's going to occur when they can leave the nursing homes again.  Your widowed grandparents are going to bang at least 6 complete strangers on lobster night because they heard it was an aphrodisiac.\n\n# Price targets:\n\n$NCLH:  Probably $46 by 2022.  $60 by 2023\n\n$CCL and $CUK:  $35 by 2022.  $47 by 2023.  For $CUK subtract 5 bucks\n\n$RCL:  $90 by 2022.  $96 by 2023\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How do you play it?\n\nWell, retard, one thing you definitely don't do is play short term FD's on this.  Sorry, I know how much you love them, but have you considered shorting $RIOT if you hate money?  You'll get the same effect, but you can at least say you lost money on digital fake money, which will make you rare.  The answer here is OTM leaps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL:DR:  If you ain't got cruise stonks, you ain't black\n\n# Position disclaimers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$CCL:  700 1/22 $25c's.  I'll likely expand this position to 1000 options\n\n$NCLH:  2000 1/23 $42.5c's.  I'll very likely add another 3000 2023 calls if there's some terrible news that causes a precipitous drop\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll my love,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Chad Dickens\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1:  of course I posted this right as Reddit shit the bed.

Not only do I think the growing semiconductor shortage is a super beneficial circumstance for $ON, given their ability to make many of the semiconductors required for [automotive and industrial computers/robots/appliances](https://www.onsemi.com/products). I also think they sit in an incredibly good position to receive a brunt of whatever the Biden admin is preparing to announce in support of the industry due to their large holding in the US. Further, I think they sit in a great space in the recent Texas weather debacle because [*they don't own any fabs in Texas,* something many other US semi's can't say.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants#Open_plants) \n\n[Weekly Chart](https://i.imgur.com/vSknBaG.png?1)\n\nSo far their weekly chart has been a very easy hold. The one dip its taken so far has disappeared quicker than it arrived, and I think only happened due to knock on market forces from the S&P value loss from the Texas disaster. \n\nHowever, I think there is something crucially undervalued already in $ON. Its options gamma. \n\n[Option Volatility](https://i.imgur.com/mz5ESeV.png)\n\nThe stock has a historically low IV at the moment, effectively suppressing the cost of its calls and puts. It sits currently at just 47 on its 30 day implied volatility with a 52 week range of 37-133. Thats very low for this stock. This seems crazy. The market for semiconductors is due to have one heck of a shift, up or down, which will raise all option's gammas, if the Biden admins announced support are anything to be believed.\n\nIn summary, I like this stock *a lot*. I think it has the potential to take a big leg up if the subsidy program breaks its way, and even if it doesn't, $ON will benefit from being pulled up by the growing interest in the semiconductor market. But the kicker, is even if the Biden program falls flat, any action in the sector will almost certainly see a volatility spike in the semiconductor industry stocks which will let our gamma value increase. This stock is in the perfect position to break out in my opinion even with a rare IV spread potential.", "comments": [{"body": "I bought call option 50 dollars for April and it's tanked so far", "created": 1613770030.0}, {"body": "I ended up buying into STM about a month ago after I saw they had designed a majority of the components in SpaceX Starlink user terminals.

It's currently sitting at 70 USD.  I think it is wildly overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bumble IPOed in the post Online Dating World**\n\nOnline dating peaked several years ago.  Since then Match Group has pretty much taken control of all the other major Apps.  Tinder turned into a shit show, and then Bumble was created out of the belief that Tinder could be done better.  \n\nIn the meantime everyone and their mother has weighed in on Online Dating, it's rise, decline and the Class Action against Match.  Online Dating is considered awful, and many have taken note of the microtransactions that fund these companies.  \n\nSo we know market is oversaturated with Dating Apps.  There are tons of them.  We know people don't have a great opinion of these Apps, in fact you can find a lot of negative opinions on Reddit.  So why did it have such a robust IPO?\n\n**Bumble Is Living In The Pandemic Bubble**\n\nI'm of the opinion there are several companies and services right now experiencing a boom that could only happen because of the lockdowns and social distancing.  Your food delivery services, streaming services, and you guessed it Bumble, all benefit from the current conditions.  Once people are free to get back out into the world that bubble is going to pop.  \n\n**The counter argument is that once we get back to normal everyone can start seeing each other from Bumble so things will really take off.  But this is flawed.**\n\nRight now people are using Bumble, not meeting up, ghosting, having conversations that fizzle out.  So there will be a number of people frustrated with online dating, people leaving Bumble because they prefer real life interactions.  Bumble is running through clients who really don't have the ability to interact safely or enjoyably during this time.  They are building up burnout.\n\nThat burnout will lead to people abandoning the App.  Either in the form of dissatisfaction or excitement at being able to go back out into public.  During the lockdown they will have been conditioned to think of Bumble as a fun distraction, but not an actual tool to meeting people since they haven't been getting out.\n\n**How Does Bumble Make Money?**\n\nThey sell things to enhance \"the experience\" of Bumble.  Basically seeing who likes you, being seen by more people, the occasional AD too.  This is dependent on one thing.  People willing to pay and be on the App.  If people don't pay for the extra transactions because they are frustrated, don't think they need them, or think it's a scam, Bumble won't make money.  If people make an exodus from Bumble because a better, \"free\" App comes along, or people burnout, then companies won't want to pay for AD space.\n\n**Match Is Ahead Of Bumble**\n\nMatch does something Bumble doesn't.  They schedule live events for people to meet up as a group.  That means they are partnering with businesses and getting them revenue.  For Match this means they backstop their App from burnout by being able to get people face to face.  Match also operates like a gym.  You sign up, pay a fee that renews and then you forget about it.  Bumble makes you consciously choose to pay for crap.  Match offers their microtransactions as a side from the main money maker, subscriptions.  Match ties the subscriptions to being able to message and see messages.  That's more of a draw than just seeing likes on an App that doesn't let you message first.\n\n**Is Bumble A 20 Dollars Stock?**\n\nWhat does it have to offer beyond what it is in a saturated market?  What is the big new thing they are doing to justify being at 70 to 40 bucks?  What are it's plans to navigate a posit COVID world?  I haven't seen these answered.  I still can't understand why it's a public company other than to fund itself with the IPO.

This means that MRO should be trading AT LEAST at $14.93. This is why most analysts like Morningstar or raise its evaluation to $11 or $13, but I think they're being too conservative with its valuation. \n\nFor one, MRO revenue in September increased 177% from the previous quarter while costs were about the same. The price of oil from March to June was about $30 while from June to Sept it stayed around $40. With just a $10 change in the price of oil, MRO was able to more than double its revenue. With oil prices nearing $50 now, it's very likely MRO will post a profit in Q4 2020.\n\nOnce they post a profit, MRO will return back to its true value of $10.89 billion meaning the price will SPIKE to $14.93. IMO the big funds have it WRONG because $11-$13 is undervaluing MRO. Their evaluations also rely on the assumption that MRO will lose money throughout 2021. \n\nPeople will say that oil isn't as hot as renewables, which is true, but oil isn't gonna go away either. Between now and 2030, people still need oil to drive cars. Remember that gas powered cars are still 97.5% of all cars on the road right now. \n\nFurthermore, IF Tesla somehow pops, many electric car companies may pop as well and they might switch to gas car or oil companies. This can act as a hedge in the event Tesla pops. \n\n\npositions: MRO 10c 3/05/21 7 contracts, 50 shares.", "comments": [{"body": "Keep talking...get this thing to meme status.

I bought a house in 2017-2018 when interest rates were high around 5%. With the recent low interest rates I started looking around. At the same time I was also looking to consolidate and refinance two private student loans. This was November of last year (2020) \n\nSoFi reeled me with the student loan refinance first. The whole process took literally a few steps to complete. I never had to call up anyone or provide additional information beyond the basic stuff required. I was able to consolidate (2) loans from Firstmark to SoFi within basically a week.. \n\nWow, so now I'm impressed by how easy the experience was with the student loan refinance and at the same time I'm dealing with a refinance process through PNC bank (who held the original loan) and they are giving me a hard ass time. I mean it was months of back and forth to the point where I stopped the process at the final disclosure and moved the process over to SoFi half out of spite to the PNC people I was dealing with. Now I wont say refinancing a home is easy, but the people at SoFi were professional and helped get it done as fast as they could. \n\nSo great, I now have my student loans and my home loan through SoFi. Next, I get an email that invites me to sign up for a credit card with 2% cash back that can be applied directly to the student loan or redeemed for stocks. I think how great this is and sign up, get my card in a week and start using it to get points/money towards my student loan. Also at this point, I set up a trading account because I was playing around with the credit card redemption options. The trading platform needs work, but I like where it\u2019s headed. The redemption for stock and stock slices are two items I cannot do with my TD account and will enjoy using. \n\nSo from November 2020 to February 2021, I completed/opened (2) Loans, (1) credit card, and (1) trading account.. All of this and I had not been aware that SoFi was going public through a SPAC until after I had completed all of the things mentioned above so I was curious to look into it once I found out about it. I read the investor slides and quickly realized that 1) I fit their target demographic and 2) I completely demonstrated (to myself) exactly how they plan to get people in and then get them to use additional products within their ecosystem once they are. I completely see this platform as a potential for enormous growth over the next few years because SoFi sucks you in and sells you on multiple product offerings so quickly and easily. The best part is that you\u2019ll love the one app on your phone for everything. I have like 8 banking apps right now and I cannot wait to consolidate over the next few years into one product.\n\nAnyway, that is my .02 and why I'm bullish on the stock 225shares avg@22.87.

However, even though I still believe RH's close partnership with Citadel did have an influence on their decision to outright ban buying of the stock (but not selling), we DO need to focus on the real problem here, which isn't necessarily Robinhood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVlad's first interview was on CNBC on the day of the restrictions (link in comments) . Vlad went on CNBC and originally claimed that the decision to limit buying on the securities was a \"difficult decision\" and it was to \"protect the firm and protect our customers\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater, Vlad came on CNN to again reaffirm that the problems at Robinhood were not liquidity issues. (link in comments)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom further statements and his Congressional testimony, we now know more about the details about what happened on the 28th. Vlad received a phone call from the DTCC at 4 AM asking him to raise the collateral necessary from Robinhood by tenfold (a number of about $3,000,000,000 total). Understandably so, a company like Robinhood which, according to estimates, is only worth about $10 billion itself does not have $3 billion lying around to post as collateral. This, although almost a textbook definition of a liquidity problem, is denied to be a liquidity problem by Vlad. I believe Vlad specifically uses the phrase \"Robinhood does not have a liquidity problem\" because he was EVENTUALLY able to raise the capital necessary to continue operations within the next few days (albeit at the expense of the consumer whose longs were already able to be covered by shorts in that time period).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Vlad actually gave any sort of shit about the everyday investor, he would be using his platform to criticize the DTCC requirements, especially after such short notice (a 4AM phone call when the stock spiked). The DTCC raising collateral requirements by tenfold during the entire saga is unprecedented, and frankly ridiculous considering how much money the DTCC processes on a weekly basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Vlad Tenev is a puppet and can't act on behalf of his \"client base\" to criticize the parties that should actually be held responsible for what happened on the 28th, so any backlash Robinhood gets is still well deserved.

Robinhood (through his clearing house) gives a buy order to Citadel Hedge Fund in GameStop \u2013 since Robinhood is not a hedge fund itself.\n\nCitadel confirms to Robinhood that the trade has been done **without first locating the shares** and so Robinhood takes the $40 million from Buyer A and passes it to Citadel. When the trade fails to deliver on T+3 because Citadel has not located the required amount of GameStop shares, the buyer can order a buy-in from Citadel, who can request the use of the **DTCC's stock borrow programme.**\n\nThe DTCC sees that in its **lending pool** Webull has one million GameStop shares. The DTCC takes the $40 million as collateral from Citadel and registers this as owing in his account. The DTCC then pays Webull $40 million and borrows Webull's 1 million GameStop shares \"temporarily\". The DTCC then puts the 1 million GameStop shares into Buyer A's account with Robinhood through a clearing house. Meanwhile, Webull now has $40 million in his DTCC cash account to earn interest on until the DTCC returns the 1 million GameStop shares, once they have been returned by Citadel. The crucial issue is how and where Webull got these shares to put in the lending pool. **The GameStop shares actually belong to Investor B who has an account with Webull and does not know that his shares have been lent out.**\n\nIn theory, Investor B need never know what has happened to his shares, as Citadel should find a seller of GameStop shares and return the shares to the DTCC. The DTCC would then put back those shares into Webull's lending pool. **However, the DTCC does not keep track of how long these loans are outstanding**. As a result Citadel is under no pressure to return the borrowed shares unless it wants its $40 million back from the DTCC. So when it is time for clients to receive their monthly statements from Robinhood and Webull, Buyer A's account will say he owns 1 million shares in GameStop , and Investor B's account says he owns 1 million shares in GameStop.

The other half of the company, Carnival PLC, primarily trades on the London Stock Exchange, though are additionally listed on NYSE under ticker $CUK. Both tickers are tied to the same entity and trade in tandem, but not always perfectly. For all intents and purposes, they\u2019re the same shares. The only real benefit to holding $CCL over $CUK is liquidity. $CCL is without a doubt more liquid and sees higher volume each day, no disputing it. \n\nBut the dividend is the same, the voting rights are the same, the shares rise and fall like they\u2019re holding hands on a swing set.

I did some research and found out that Rolls Royce makes most of its money from the number of hours it\u2019s engines fly. I then found out that Rolls Royce is a national treasure of England\u2019s, and England would try very hard to keep supporting them.

They are the second largest competitor in the engine industry(behind general electric) but are priced for bankruptcy? They literally can not go bankrupt. Their balance sheets look scary but they are so well established and relied on all around the world.

Flowers has beaten estimates on their last eight earnings to the tune of 15-24%\n\nThis isn\u2019t a pump and dump that you\u2019re going to make 60% in a week. But a 20% share price gain can still take you to tendy town with the right call options and a good batch of shares. The last week of crabbing share price has dropped the IV since the last earnings price spikes, making it a perfect opportunity to pick up some calls pre-Q3 fiscal results in April.\n\n# \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80  The Bull Case   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the only reason this stock is trading sub $40 is that their growth hasn\u2019t been drop dead sexy. It\u2019s been consistently seasonal, but it hasn\u2019t really blown the roof off the fucker\u2026 until fiscal Q2. Industry analysts always expect Flowers to have a strong Q2 (September - December is their growth months); however, they never expected the company to post $1.72 EPS \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80 . Flowers not only made more money overall, but they also managed to lower management costs and improve e-commerce growth (up 59.7% YOY). On some level, a portion of this could be due in part to COVID-19 driving consumers online. Local traditional florists were small businesses that have been shuttered by cancellations of large-scale events and local business restrictions. Many will not re-open, or can not compete with the FLWS model. The real question is will the average consumer return to purchasing at their local florist if they\u2019re even open anymore, or just become a  customer. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nJust before the earnings bomb was dropped the share price rose to a 52 week high, \\~$37 on hype alone. Paper hands lit up and it dumped down to $28. The bull case would see the stock climb back to 40 over the next 2-3 months, and perhaps even touching $45 before Fiscal Q3 earnings are due in April, 2021. Wall Street expects a net loss of 9c/share. If Flowers can beat this and go positive, it would mark the first time the company made a profit per share in Q3. I would imagine this would signal a shift in the companies growth, and lead the stock to some sort of breakout. If their newest acquisitions can drive earnings in the off-season (Q1, Q3 and Q4) then expect a huge upside.\n\nFurther, Flowers has made some power purchases over the last two years to expand its eCommerce reach. Their most recent acquisitions include:\n\n1. **\ud83c\udf53**  *Berries.com (Shari\u2019s Berrys \u2013 Purchased 08/19 for $20.5 million)*  **\ud83c\udf53**\n\na. This was a steal. Shari was about to start selling used panties online after her retail model resulted in multiple store closures. Flowers stepped in and scaled the business into a successful e-commerce business on berries.com. Now they\u2019re dipping 9 million berries a year at \\~$3.75/berry. I would imagine the margins are pretty big on these given how little a strawberry and some dipping chocolate costs.\n\n2.  \ud83d\udcb0 *PersonalizationMall (Purchased 2/20 $252 million)* \ud83d\udcb0\n\nA big player in the personalized gift space. Ranks above Etsy on an organic google search (which is nuts), and is going to expose Flowers to a new sector for growth. What\u2019s especially important about this acquisition is that the site drives business year-round. Flowers has a VERY cyclical earnings cycle subject to huge swings based on seasonal revenue (the lion share of the companies earnings comes Thanksgiving through Christmas). This site will drive revenue in the dry fiscal quarters for the company (Q1, Q3 & Q4) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n3 . \ud83d\ude80 *The gay bears are betting against us*\ud83d\ude80\n\nThe stock has historically been shorted. As of 1/29/21 data, the stock is 20% of float short, down significantly since earnings. I wouldn\u2019t call it squeezable, but there are some strong bets against the stock, most of which are looking pretty dumb right now. It would take \\~ 4 days for them to cover based on estimates. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n4. \ud83d\ude80 *The financials look good*\ud83d\ude80\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvjy8opeegi61.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ada09b901fd6b270ff8100095b90d7e20f454d\n\n30% asset growth in 2020, that's the exponential growth I'm getting on. Before that we were seeing sub 10% asset growth. If Flowers can keep this type of growth, I really like the stock even more. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80   \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\n## [\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b](https://thisinterestsme.com/rainbow-bear-emoji/)The Bear Case  [\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b](https://thisinterestsme.com/rainbow-bear-emoji/)\n\nLook, Flowers is a seasonal business. EPS is over a dollar in Fiscal Q2, and is often negative, or barely positive, in the remaining months. The gay bears betting against this stock believe that it\u2019s possible Flowers doesn\u2019t go net positive for the rest of fiscal 2021. The question on everyone's mind, is the stock actually making a positive growth trend? Or was this just a fluke based on COVID-19 closures?\n\nIf the gay bear theories prove true, the stock could sink. Flowers doesn\u2019t report positive news very often, only on acquisitions and fiscal Q2 earnings. The rest of the year is basically hype. A few shitty news cycles and this stock could have a VERY negative sentiment. If Flowers doesn\u2019t blow away Fiscal Q3, I wouldn\u2019t expect much movement above $30-35.

An AM call has only happened one other time in Purples history and it was when they beat on earnings and increased guidance from \\~325M to \\~400M.** I am extremely Bullish on how this call will be taken by the media because there will likely be a huge GAAP earnings (hopefully, I'm not an accountant) due to 4 quarters of warrant accruals reversing. Also, the mattress industry as a whole is doing well, look at TPX and SNBR, both beat and moved significantly after their earnings calls.\n\nPlease be conservative in your plays as I don't want people crying to me later, also do your own research, go try a bed or a cushion and understand why I like their products.\n\n# What I am expecting\n\n* A big GAAP earnings due to accrual reversal\n* An Adjusted EBITDA beat, street is saying .11 cents, I am expecting 20-30 cents.\n* Guidance for 2021, Street is saying 826M, I assume they will guide to 875M+ and deliver 925M+\n* New product discussion- I am expecting they will talk about new premium products\n* Partner expansion- if you haven't read my previous DD, please look. they are in about 1800 American stores and 300 Canadian stores. There are tons of expansion opportunities, even with just their existing partner Mattress firm.\n* I am hoping they mention their expected capital investment- they are expected to nearly fill their second factory with 4-6 lines, based on previous calls.\n* 2022 revenue potential- I expect they will end this year with 1.2-1.3B worth of capacity, it would be good to understand this on their guidance call so you can see the potential for the coming years.\n\n# How to play the earnings call - I own debit spreads only but there are multiple ways.\n\n* Super conservative, sell 30.00 and 35.00 purple puts for March\n* Mildly conservative, sell 40.00 puts for March\n* Aggressive, sell 45.00 and 50.00 puts for March\n* Conservative, buy shares\n* Mildly conservative, 20/30, 30/40 debit spreads.\n* Aggressive, 35/45 40,45, 40/50 debit spreads - These are risky IMO\n* Mildly conservative, buy LEAPS- though these are thinly traded.\n\nBe careful out there. Also, options for out months are thinly traded so make sure you understand limit orders as you can get screwed by the bid ask.\n\nFeel free to DM me with questions.

About 80% of the parts are the same across an EV or traditional (aka non-hybrid) ICE vehicle. We know the big hedgies employ engineers or engineering research firms, so why shouldn't we get some of the same background. This is about the other 20% of parts.\n\nEdit: TLDR - EV part stonks go brrrrrrrr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMajor EV specific parts:\n\nBattery Cells - one of the more expensive parts, actually contain the energy. There's many different types. Large suppliers typically include Panasonic (PCRFY), LG Chem (KRX: 051910), and Samsung (SSDIY). OEMs are also getting more involved in this space through joint ventures / partnerships\n\nBattery pack - basically just an electromechanical assembly of cells. Electromechanical = connect the battery cells, make sure the battery pack is safe, and get rid of heat generated by the cells.\n\nInverters - basically also motor controllers or variable frequency drives (VFD). All the power to the wheels goes through the inverters so a small increase in efficiency here can be very helpful to increase range. The main component in an inverter is transistors, which are basically a super high power switch controlled by a computer to turn on and off thousands of times a second. SiC (silicon carbide) transistors/inverters are the current standard, but GaN (gallium nitride) could further reduce size & weight and increase efficiency. The \"best\" high power inverters typically use a vertical transistor, which due to engineering reasons is more easily adjusted for different power applications (basically vertical transistors get 3-dimensions of adjustability, while horizontal transistors get 2-dimensions). The GaN vertical transistors are a newer technology, and the early companies stand to make a bunch of money imo. These include GaN Systems & Odyssey Semiconductor (ODII) and many others. Some of these are currently OTC, so you can't trade on Vlad's platform.\n\nMotors/Drive Units - aka the spinny boiz. Lots of companies seem to be designing their own motors from what I found so no specific additional plays. They're being designed in house so that they can maximize efficiency based on how the companies think they'll be used.\n\nBeyond these there are a ton of specific electronic parts that are needed but these are the major ones imo.

The price has gone down because of some negative media attention, trying to drive the price down in combination with lockup expiry that happened yesterday.  TGIF and we're seeing some premarket action in a positive direction today.\n\nBut what does Palantir actually do?  That's the question everyone wants answered.  It's tough for people who aren't involved in the type of stuff the company does to understand, but there was a decent explanation done on Quora a few years ago that is still VERY relevant to the company, even as they branch out into the private sector.  Yes, they are still heavily involved in government contracts for the good ol' US of A and her allies, but now that it has a solid foothold and has developed its software to be crucial in development of foundational intelligence in a variety of government sectors, they are moving into spaces which are going to be more profitable for shareholders.\n\nSo here comes the Quora response.  It's from 6 years ago and comes from a blog that has since been upgraded to a full up website and this post has gone away from it, but it's still very relevant to the here and now even with the fast pace of technology today.  **Seriously, if you are in Palantir or are thinking about getting into it, read it.  It's a short read, and a good beginning for someone trying to figure out just what the fuck this company does.**\n\n*By Kevin Simler*\n\nI often ask candidates if they\u2019re familiar with what we do at Palantir. Most people think they are. \u201cOh, you\u2019re that data viz. company,\u201d or, worse, \u201cYou guys do data mining, right?\u201d At least they\u2019ve heard of us and at least they\u2019re on the right track, but I cringe anyway. We aren\u2019t just a \u201cdata visualization\u201d company and we don\u2019t do \u201cdata mining.\u201d It\u2019s almost impossible to convey the scope and complexity of what we do in a few short minutes\u2014or to do so without taking the conversation to an eye-glazing level of abstraction.\n\nThe following is my attempt at describing what we do at a high level without oversimplifying. I hope that after reading this a candidate will \u2018get\u2019 what we\u2019re about, or at least understand enough not to apply tiny labels to our expansive vision.The problem: implementing analysisAt Palantir we specialize in **analysis**.Yes, that\u2019s painfully abstract, and I\u2019ll get to it in a second.In real-world terms, we are building a **software platform** that enables people to take whatever data is relevant to them and understand it more easily and thoroughly than ever before, using concepts that they already understand. And we are applying this vision, at first, to solving problems in the finance sector and the government intelligence community.The first important thing to note is that we don\u2019t actually do the analysis ourselves. We don\u2019t devise winning trading strategies and we don\u2019t catch terrorists. We write software that enables other people to pull off these feats. These people, experts in their respective fields, are called \\*analysts.\\*So what exactly do analysts do? What is analysis?\n\n>Analysis is everything necessary to extract **insight** from **information**.\n\nLet\u2019s break that down a bit.Information is easy: It\u2019s data. It lives in a relational database or as files indexed on a hard drive, and you can easily run queries against it. It comes in two forms, structured and unstructured. And there is *a lot* of it in the modern world \u2013 too much, actually, for current tools to make sense of.Insight is trickier. Insight is something only a person can generate, and understanding this is critical for any organization that wants to do analysis right. Thus the challenge of data analysis is how to bring vast amounts of information into productive contact with human intelligence. In other words, the challenge is how to *enable the analyst*.From the analyst\u2019s perspective there are five essential features of an analysis platform:\n\n1. First, and most important, ***the analyst should be in control***. In other words, the primary way of interacting with an analysis tool should be *human-driven queries*. While automated approaches can complement a human-driven approach, there simply is no substitute for human intelligence. Unless you put a person behind the wheel, the system can never be flexible or creative enough to uncover truly original insight. Artificial Intelligence just isn\u2019t there yet.\n2. Ability to ***summarize large data sets***. Some of this is what has traditionally been called data mining: the largely automated approach\u2014using machine learning or other statistical techniques\u2014of processing lots of data at once and extracting nuggets that capture something interesting about the data. Unlike Palantir, traditional approaches have focused almost exclusively on this aspect of analysis.\n3. Ability to ***visualize large data sets***. Here the analyst wants interesting and informative ways of viewing data graphically, to make it easier for him to digest. The analyst wants more than just a summary of the data; he wants a nuanced view of what\u2019s going on*inside* these data sets: What\u2019s the overall shape of the distribution? What are the outliers? What are important structures within the data?\n4. Ability to ***iterate rapidly***. This means enabling the analyst to ask a question, get the answer, and then quickly ask either a variant on the initial question or a follow-up question that depends on the answer to the initial question. This rapid, iterative process allows the analyst to quickly test out hypotheses and develop theories about what\u2019s going on in the data, and by extension to discover what\u2019s going on in the world.\n5. Ability to ***collaborate with other analysts***. Getting a handle on a terabyte of data, especially when it comprises multiple data types, is definitely more than a one-person job. Any organization that\u2019s serious about understanding the world needs a team of analysts that can work together as more than the sum of its parts. This requires the ability for one analyst to effortlessly share the results of his analysis with his colleagues.\n\nThe Palantir approachThat\u2019s what analysis looks like to the analyst, or rather what it should look like in an ideal world. (Current tools fall far short of this vision.) So what do *we* do at Palantir in order to make analysis this smooth and easy?You could say that we help summarize large data sets, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a rich library of techniques and algorithms. You could also say that we do visualization, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a set of interesting and informative ways of visualizing their data. We do both of these things, and we have to be creative and solve hard problems in order to add value in these areas. But we do a lot more than that.Probably the most central hard problem that we address in trying to enable the analyst is **data modeling**, the process of figuring out what data types are relevant to a domain, defining what they represent in the world, and deciding how to represent them in the system. At Palantir we make sure our data model (ontology) is both flexible and dynamic, and that it mirrors the concepts people naturally use when reasoning about the domain. This is no small challenge, but we\u2019re already making it a reality. In finance our basic data types include financial instruments, dates, portfolios, indices, and strategies\u2014the same things that financial researchers think about, talk about, and reason with. In the intelligence product our basic data types include people, places, and events (all with associated properties), which is exactly the way we all represent the world in our minds.Data modeling, data summarization, and data visualization are the core disciplines for approaching large data sets. Human-driven queries, rapid iteration, and collaboration are multipliers, taking the power unlocked by the core disciplines to the next level. When these pieces are brought together in a coherent system, the result is in an analysis platform both very generic and very powerful.This is what we mean when we say that we\u2019re changing the way people approach data. Welcome to the future of analysis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Obligatory  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.  This is a LONG TERM HOLD, it's not gonna moonshot fast.

I can only guess they are being conservative given it's their first year as a publicly listed company. The rest of WS are just retards like us. PLTR is more deserving of the 100x forward revenue than SNOW is. \n\nDon't listen to the blind bats. PLTR is a $75 company this year and a $200 if it continues to beat revenue projections. The only thing I hate about it is the SBC. They have to rein that in. Can't keep paying employees massive stock options.

Bringing a cable that costs thousands of dollars per meter to connect a couple of retards in the outback is not the best move telecommunications companies can do. But as usual. Elon Musk believes that everyone should have access to fast and reliable connection which is why he decided to create a company to fix this problem.\n\nWith the covid we are also seeing another exodus from the city, people are beginning to be more interested in moving out and if they can have fast and reliable access to the internet far in the woods or near the beach, remote work is going to keep getting bigger and more interesting for employees. On a personal note, I currently have two jobs and since the beginning of the pandemic I have been working from home for both. After meeting with the direction for each job, the productivity of the employees has not been impacted at all and I don\u2019t think that every employee will be coming back to work once it is done because we saw that remote work was not only possible but was also as much productive and much more convenient for some of us.\n\nSpaceX mentioned to their investors that Starlink is trying to enter the $1 trillion market of the internet market all around the world. They also stated that it would cost around $10 billion to build their network. They planned to reach a revenue of $30 billion to $50 billion a year according to their research. Musk announced the project and in less than 2 months, they received more than 700 000 applications across the United States, not bad at all!\n\n**Company background**\n\nStarlink is a satellite internet provider constructed by SpaceX (if you don\u2019t know who is SpaceX, go take a run on the highway with your eyes closed plz) their goal is to bring fast and reliable internet to everyone but will focus on rural and remote communities at first.\n\nThey began their product development back in 2015 and are now testing their product in the US, Canada and UK.\n\nFinancials\n\nWe don\u2019t have much information about the financials of Starlink at the moment, we know that they are backed by SpaceX and the owner is the richest man on the planet, or the second richest depending on when you look at the list.\n\n**The Product**\n\nNow you may ask (or probably already know) how can they achieve that? Well Musk is the owner of a small company that is launching rockets in space, after some thinking he came up with his team with the idea to launch thousands of satellites in orbit to create a whole constellation that would make the internet accessible everywhere.\n\nThey began the development of their product back in 2015, launched their first two prototypes in 2018 and added 60 more in 2019. They are currently using the Falcon 9 to launch 60 satellites at a time and on January 17th it was their 17th launch that brought the total amount to a total of about 960 satellites in orbit. They also had another launch a couple of days ago and sadly, the rocket landed somewhere in the ocean instead of on the landing pad and they were not able to recover it. (I would like to mention that it was the 6th time they were using it, still a fucking legend to my eyes)\n\nCan you currently use their service?\n\nYes but no. The registration is open on their website but you need to be in certain areas and there are a maximum number of people that will get it for now since it is still in beta.\n\nNow one concern could be: How good is it really? Because we already have internet connection from satellites at the moment with company like Xplornet and the connection is fucking sh\\*t and expensive af for nothing (link in sources) Well Starlink is far from being the same, while Xplornet is using only TWO satellites that are at 36 thousand kilometers from earth, Starlink are planning to have 42 THOUSAND satellites in orbit at less than 500 kilometers from earth. It will probably never be as good as fiber but it will still be very fast and available everywhere (and incredibly better than what is currently available right now). It is also going to indirectly (and maybe directly in the future) compete with the 5g network that is coming up soon but I don\u2019t think it should be a major concern for the moment! (Daddy Musk, please leave a chance to Nokia to live and prosper with their 5g network)\n\nHow expensive is it?\n\nFor the moment, for the \u201ctesters\u201d, if you want to get your hands on starlink internet you will need to pay an upfront fee of $499 to get your starlink kit (terminal to connect to the satellites and wifi router) and a $99/month. We don\u2019t have any information about the future price of such service but I assume that like drugs, the more customers they will have, the cheaper it will get.\n\n**Possible IPO**\n\nYes you heard it correctly, Elon actually considers making an IPO for Starlink, the king of twitter posted an answer saying that it is a possibility but that he only consider doing that in a couple of years when the revenue growth will be \u201csmooth and predictable\u201d\n\nSo of course that is making me really sad because I would like to spend a couple grand on this man\u2019s idea but he is a smart man and who knows, maybe it will be sooner!There are rumors that the blank company Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd which just went public btw, could be the perfect fit for that matter, there is a post from another user that I recommend reading if you are interested in those kinds of things.\n\n**Does it make sense? (AKA Conclusion)**\n\nI am a big fan of Elon Musk, I am not afraid to say that I would probably follow him in each and single one of his projects and invest if given the opportunity. To be honest, the balls on this man and the discipline mixed with his stubbornness to make the world become a better place is truly amazing.\n\nThe main competitor would be amazon who is also planning to launch their satellite internet in the future with their project Kuiper, they have not communicated any timeline yet which could mean that Starlink would be the only one in the field for a couple of months (most likely years).\n\nI still think that with his leadership and the resources available for Starlink, the project is bound to be a success, I also believe that it is only a test to see if his idea could work before taking it to Mars so I am not concerned at all by his ability to become one of the biggest internet provider on the planet.\n\noF cOuRse I aM nOt a fInaNciAl aDvIsOr\n\nIt is my mom who is in charge of my money so make your own research even tho there is not any company to invest in right now lol\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk\n\nYoutube Video for the retards\n\n[http://ow.ly/4m3d30rxx08](http://ow.ly/4m3d30rxx08)\n\n(If the video is a problem for the mods tell me and I'll remove it)\n\nSources:\n\nBloomberg\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/musk-targets-telecom-for-next-disruption-with-starlink-internet?utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm\\_source=twitter&utm\\_content=business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/musk-targets-telecom-for-next-disruption-with-starlink-internet?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=business)\n\nSpace\n\n[https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-60-starlink-satellites-rocket-landing-feb-15-2021](https://www.space.com/spacex-launches-60-starlink-satellites-rocket-landing-feb-15-2021)\n\nXplornet\n\n[https://www.xplornet.com/support/billing-account/customer-package-upgrade-add-ons/packages-for-current-customers-satellite/](https://www.xplornet.com/support/billing-account/customer-package-upgrade-add-ons/packages-for-current-customers-satellite/)\n\nCNBC\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/27/spacex-starlink-service-priced-at-99-a-month-public-beta-test-begins.html)\n\nObserver\n\n[https://observer.com/2020/09/elon-musk-tweet-spacex-starlink-ipo-satellite-internet/](https://observer.com/2020/09/elon-musk-tweet-spacex-starlink-ipo-satellite-internet/)\n\nElon\u2019s Tweet\n\n[http://ow.ly/EqUh30rxx0i](http://ow.ly/EqUh30rxx0i)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit Post about potential IPO through PSTH\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kos9y9/starlinkpsth\\_timeline/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kos9y9/starlinkpsth_timeline/)\n\nAmazon\u2019s project Kuiper\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/fcc-authorizes-amazon-to-build-kuiper-satellite-internet-network.html)", "comments": [{"body": "Too lazy to follow all links, tell me if OP is hiding some lame somewhere", "created": 1613737471.0}, {"body": "Never heard of Starlkin.

They want instant settlement and dark pools on the open market. This is their game plan. This would allow them to hold less for settlement and use more of their money to fuck you over! It would also give them more access in taking on the bigger fish by getting rid of dark pools. I imagine there are some pension funds etc that also use dark pools. This is all their narrative to help them become bigger fish! Note Vlad didn\u2019t like 1 day settlement.\n\nThird, there was one question about the danger of options trades. The congressman who asked is on my shitlist. However during the hearing RH disclosed how they\u2019ve made 5x more money since allowing options i.e. its likely they\u2019ve been fucking over your options trades.\n\nFourth, this liquidity problem was made up behind closed doors! They made up this problem so they didn\u2019t have to perjur themselves. Evidence of this is THE MOST important question was asked by David Houstoff of TN, if it wasn\u2019t for the settlement time this wouldn\u2019t have happened? \nVlad is a shitty liar and sidestepped slightly by not fully answering, he said it would avoid some of the problems. I.e. they never had an intention of letting this trade go through even without this \u201ccrisis\u201d.\n\nFive, these asshats keep acting like Vlad speaks for retail, yet DFV is literally at the hearing?! Like WTF! \n\nSix, why ask these corrupt fucks for ANY suggestions? They used it to advertise, act as if they care about retail, and push their wish list.\n\nSeventh, very important, when citadel was asked about the DTCC he looked to the left during his response. Clear sign of lying, but speculation I guess. \n\nLastly, Melvin sounded like a little bitch and his office looked empty.

Just 1 or all?\n* Is the punishment for creating phantom shares greater then the reward for obtaining lot's of interest free money?\n* What happens to the price of a stock when someone floods the market with a huge constant supply of phantom shares?\n* In what ways can phantom shares be used to decide which companies get to have a fighting chance and which companies get to have their faiths sealed? \n* Why did it take WEEKS to find all of Michael Burry's shares?\n* Are the shorters of GME the one's we should truly be paying the most attention to or is shorting just a result of trying to make money off a much much more nefarious thing at play here? \n* What happens to all the retail investors who own fake shares of GME if the GME board of directors were to call in ALL the real shares back?\n* How many institutional investors where also buying alongside retail investors?\n* How much of the GME buying volume was from buying to cover/close?\n* Why did short's not cover when the price went to as low as $3 and simply lock in profits then?\n* Do shorters need to pay taxes if the company they short goes bankrupt and thus don't need to ever realize their gains?\n* Who owns the DTCC?\n* Did anyone who partially owned the DTC have a short position in GME?\n* Who at the DTCC decided to raise the requirements?\n* At the end of the road if none of the broker's or market makers have the collateral, who foots the bill?\n* Why did the DTCC notify brokers that early in the morning? \n* Who where the one's buying put's on GME right before Robinhood restricted buying?\n* Why did the DTCC not chill and/or freeze GME?\n* Are we perhaps putting TOO much focus on Robinhood and not enough focus on the DTCC's role  that lead up to all broker's having to do what they ended up doing?\n* The fact is that Payment For Order Flow allowed for zero commission fees BUT what are ALL the potential NEGGATIVES of PFOF? \n* Why do many of us think the short squeeze is over?\n* How can we verify the authenticity of the short interest data?\n* Who right now even at this very moment are the one's selling shares of GME? \n* Which recently created LLC's/shell companies and similar entities started doing ANY transactions involving GME?\n* What type of transactions where those newly created entities doing? \n* How extremely risky were those transactions by those newly created entities?\n* Who any shape or form was related to the creation of those newly created entities?\n* **Perhaps after all of this the average American will still be clueless as to what exactly happened, but how will all of this shape the way in which private companies, companies with actual knowledgeable financial departments/divisions who may be deciding on whether or not to go public/have an IPO feel?**   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCat's been out of the bag for awhile Wall Street and you did this to yourself.

It's time to write your representatives in congress. As little good as it may seem to do.\n\nI sent this out last night:\n\"My concern is in regards to the lack of response or regulation to the sheer volume in \"failure to deliver\" as per the 2nd half of January's 2021 PDF posted here on the SEC website: https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n\n How is the volume of FTD's associated with GME, BB and other stocks not considered market manipulation? What are the penalties for traders generating FTD's? There were over 800k trades that never delivered for GME and over 300k for BB; but those trades instantaneously drove the stock prices despite not being associated with any physical stock certificate. Hows is there not more federal regulation on the matter in terms of CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. I understand that when a stock is purchased through a brokerage that a synthetic or \u201cphantom\u201d share is created, every 3 days the brokerage has to settle the trade of these synthetic shares that occurred on their books with the clearinghouse. When trades that failed to deliver are marked FTD, because they were not associated with any existing stock, they have 30 days to settle their obligation and at worst they may receive a downgrade in rating. By this point; the stock ticker and chart already recorded the trade as executed and the consumer investor is the one hurt from a securities price that was artificially driven down. When the sheer volume of \u201cfailure to deliver\u201d increase correlates with the crashing of a stock price; it's clear the HF traders are attempting what is unofficially named a short ladder attack. This is akin to the check-kiting that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis; and not far from naked-short selling. There needs to be regulation passed to circumvent this practice and these traders generating these FTD\u2019s need to be held accountable. The blue-collar workers and college kids are left absorbing the losses while the HF traders basically abuse their position in generating more synthetic shares while simultaneously hurting the value of businesses. \n\n Another similarity with the 2008 financial crisis is the increase in failures to deliver. Again much the same as check kiting, where someone writes a check but has not yet secured the funds to cover it, sellers did not surrender securities sold on time (FTD). They delayed the process to buy securities at a lower price for delivery to settle their obligations. They do this in the 30 day window they have been allotted to settle after a trade was marked FTD. Regulators still need to address this practice. Right now the price of several popular stocks have been manipulated down and the HF traders who FTD\u2019ed are going to buy those securities at a lower price to settle their obligations and the American people are left taking massive losses. How is this justice? Consumer investors are the ones who get hurt.\"\n\nNow there are two other things investors should know. We understand why brokerages create synthetic stocks but how do the HF traders do it? These are sold to drive prices\nhttps://youtu.be/WvO0RGsh688\n\nThis is something else investors need to be aware of on the insider trading end of the spectrum. \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/phantomstock.asp\n\nOther notable links: \n\"The delinquent firm is considered to be practicing the fraudulent act of kiting if it fails to purchase the securities on the open market and maintains a short position, delays delivery, or takes part in transactions contrary to the proper settlement of trades.\"\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kited.asp#:~:text=Kiting%20is%20the%20fraudulent%20use,which%20there%20are%20insufficient%20funds.\n\nThen worse yet: \"During the financial crisis of 2008, failures to deliver increased. Much the same as check kiting, where someone writes a check but has not yet secured the funds to cover it, sellers did not surrender securities sold on time. They delayed the process to buy securities at a lower price for delivery.

Under normal conditions the short interest at least partially makes up for any drops in price. If you are long a position, you are probably going to continue to hold the position through any temporary drops anyway. If the stock goes up, you get the short interest and your stock appreciates in value.

I assume you mean shares on margin, but you don't actually own those so your broker is allowed to loan them out since your broker is the one that technically owns those shares until you pay back your margin.\n\nThere is an easy solution to your problem called stop trading on margin.

I don't know about you guys, but for the first time in my life I was excited to watch our government (attempt to) do their job. I got on the subreddit and was met with a similar wave of enthusiasm and interest. But I also saw something else: Cynicism. There's a good chunk of us who don't really believe that congress will do their jobs. People went out of their way to point out conflicts of interest and even referred back to '08.\n\nPeople are entitled to their own opinion, such is the WSB way. But I would like to express how much I disagree with the cynics and how hopeful I am with what has transpired in the financial markets, and the world these last few months.\n\n**Individual** investors from all across the world shared research, data, their sentiments and theses with the world here on our forum. This community found the opportunity of a lifetime and we held on with conviction, and solidarity the likes of which I have never in my life seen before. We took on the giants of the financial world and made them taste blood. We exposed ***ONCE AGAIN*** the dangers of unregulated financial markets and the dangerous levels of leverage these sOpHiStIcAtEd iNvEsToRs use and justify. We exposed a systemic risk in the system and we caught the attention of media the world over.\n\nEven still, with shills and bots flooding our home we held. With fear, uncertainty and doubt sweeping across investors all across the world we held. We cost the greedy billions and collectively along with our Institutional long allies made billions in the process. We shook the finance world to it's core.\n\nSome truly savant level autists among us predicted the short squeezes, the gamma squeezes, the imminent collapse of the financial markets! A good chunk of these predictions were accurate. I'll link the original prediction posts here if I can find them, but in the meanwhile take a look at this: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-18/peterffy-markets-came-close-to-breaking-amid-gamestop-turmoil-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-18/peterffy-markets-came-close-to-breaking-amid-gamestop-turmoil-video).\n\nThat's right. We nearly collapsed the entire American financial system. All because we spotted the opportunity of a lifetime and held. At the end of the day you know what happened. This isn't a fairytale and we were screwed out of our ticket to the moon. Now before I continue with all this sentimental bullshit lets analyze today's hearing.\n\n**The Hearing**\n\nToday's hearing was definitely interesting. We saw some politicians give in and throw softball questions, but we also saw others grow a spine and start turning the screws. There was a lot of talk about new financial transaction taxes aiming to take down (scalpers) HFT's. We saw our representatives talk about decentralized finance, margin requirements, settlement times, the conflicts of interest certain firms had and the health and regulation of our financial markets.\n\nNot everything was good though. Like stated earlier some politicians folded, and some were outright bribed with campaign contributions by Ken Griffin of Citadel and Vlad Tenev of RH. We saw a few fucks even talk about eliminating Dodd Frank regulations on margin. (For those of you younger autists those were the laws enacted directly following the '08 recession and aimed to limit risk in our markets).\n\nOverall it's what you expect out of any large group of people, there were some upstanding individuals who did their duty and stood by their constituents, but there were also spineless kleptocrats who used their position and influence for gain.\n\nI don't get the cynicism though. What did you fucks expect? Congress to issue a decree forcing these fuckers to buy back all GameStop shares at $1000 per? What matters most is that we brought attention to the underlying issues that plague our financial markets and institutions. The fight is long from over but we're making strides in the right direction.\n\nChange doesn't happen in a day, not in a week or even a month. Hell when it comes to the change we seek; a truly free and fair financial market. It's likely going to take years, possibly decades to see the fruits of our labor.\n\nBIG FUCKING PROPS to our boy u/deepfuckingvalue. Keith if you're reading this homie know that you're an inspiration to us all. You had a thesis and stuck with it. A truly humble and funny guy.

It's our money and we can invest, gamble, make or lose it however we god damn please. No one gives a fuck that you think we're bagholders. We had the balls to risk our capital for gain, and losses are a risk we take. What especially pisses me off is the new people making snide remarks. If you weren't here pre GME you don't have the right to call us bagholders. The OGs of this sub know bagholders because we learned that shit the hard way holding puts while the economy was recovering or buying calls as it was tanking. We've played more earnings calls than you've even fucking listened to. I'm glad you fucks found this sub but try not to be insufferable.\n\nHere at WSB our mouths water at the opportunity of high risk high reward plays. This community used to be smart people acting like retards. Now its a community of retards who think they're savants because they paperhanded at the right time or got lucky here and there. When someone makes it big we say congrats and fuck you. When someone loses big we laugh and tell them why they're retarded. If you don't add any value to the conversation in terms of data, opinion, sentiment or otherwise don't have anything clever or funny to say do us a favor and shut the fuck up.\n\nBit unrelated to the earlier stuff but stop sucking off Fidelity. They're the institutional investors that sold off their stake and tanked the share price. Retail stood strong. I get they're a good broker dealer and are leagues ahead of their competitors, by all means do business with them, but stop sucking them off 24/7 it's annoying.\n\nPositions: $GME at cost basis of \\~$27 per share.

Let's take a look at the P/S Ratio of some of your favorite stocks and Corsairs. \n\n[P/S Ratio List](https://imgur.com/a/kTvFTZ1) Price to Sale Ration / Market Cap to Revenue Ratio\n\nI've listed the P/S Ratio and y/y growth from AMZN, AAPL, AMD, PLTR, LOGI and CRSR. You can see that CRSR is trading at a P/S Ratio of just 2.1 and that while having the highest y/y revenue growth of all listed stocks. Not only that but their last quarter had a y/y growth revenue growth of over [70%](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) and earnings 152% growth. 2020 Revenue even already beating analysts prediction for 2021 sales of $1.72 billion. Basically any tech stock is trading at P/S Ratios of 5 or higher, giving Corsair a 200% upside. \n\nAndy Paul CEO of Corsair in the Q4 ER:  \"It is clear that a new wave of gamers and streamers has entered the market as well as consumers building gaming PCs for the first time.\u00a0 Our expectation is that all these people that are new to the market will continue to buy gaming and streaming products from us for many years into the future.\"\n\nGrowth problem: What is stopping Corsair from further growth? It isn't demand. Corsairs sales could have been even greater if not for the semiconductor and general shortage. Many of Corsair products are sold out and production is being ramped up as fast as possible. Stopping their growth is the rate at which they can ramp up production. [Good news on that end](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order).\n\n\"At the moment, the company is more worried about the shortage of semiconductor components. It persisted throughout the fourth quarter,  the company could have raised even more funds if not for such restrictions. \n\nStreaming peripherals are also in high demand. Corsair said YouTube offered at least 40 million game channels in December. This makes the company\u2019s management believe that streaming activity will soon be as widespread as gaming.\"\n\nAnalyst Rod Hall continues to see Corsair as \"a high quality participant  in secular video gaming and eSports growth with a strong brand position and diversified product lineup.\"\n\nContrary to some of the newly IPOed hype and meme stocks Corsair is actually operating at a profit, barely. They are basically growing the company as fast as possible without going billions into debt. They managed over 70% y/y growth for their 4th quarter while not opertaing at a loss. This is some good management.\n\nSo where is the catch? Why is the stock down? Well there are two bad news I could find.\n\nFirst the [acquisition of Visuals by Impulse](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285508/corsair-elgato-visuals-by-impulse-acquisition-streaming-twitch) for an undisclosed amount. There is always some uncertainty with acquisitions especially when the paid amount is not stated, leading to concerns that it might have been a bad deal but this is a short term fear and the acquisition will help to reinforce the Elgato ecosystem:\n\n \u201cWith the addition of Visuals by Impulse to the Elgato family, we\u2019re  excited to extend our core mission of empowering content creators.  Design is a crucial element shaping a creator\u2019s identity, and VBI has  been at the forefront of making beautiful and interactive design  accessible to anyone,\u201d wrote Julian Fest, SVP and general manager at  Elgato, in a press release. \u201cTogether with the talented team at VBI, we  plan to push the boundaries of what design can mean for creators.\u201d \n\nSecond the Wallstreet analysts fear that \"people will stop gaming when the pandemic ends\". Decide for youself how you feel about this. I don't see how demand will substantially lessen in the next 12-15 months for current gen consoles, graphics cards and cpus and at that point next generation products will be ready. If you look at the [current steam hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam) barely 1.2% of people are using 3000 series graphics cards with only 11% of people using 2000 series gpus. Over 80% of active steam users are running systems with 2 or more generations old hardware and are potentially looking to upgrade their systems. Addtionally the entry age for gaming is getting lower and lower. More kids want to play video games and need the hardware to do so. Corsair provides All-In-One Systems, System Cases, full range Power supplies, full range cooling solutions, full range of peripherals, market leading streaming equipment, SSDs and RAM. Basically anything you will need with a pc but the CPU, GPU and motherboard.\n\nThe tech demand is not a Corsair only problem though, it is a problem for most tech stocks yet their P/S Ratios are still much higher. These \"out of tech\" rotations were already happening in summer last year because all the so smart Wallstreet analysts thought that \"nobody would buy tech anymore\" since a \"vaccine was near\". 8 months later there is no sign of any demand decline. These analyst try to be smart and predict the demand rotations, truth is TECH IS THE FUTURE. TECH WILL PREVAIL if old smelly men on Wallstreet acknowledge it or not, it doesn't change the inevitable.\n\nDemand growth will decrease eventually but demand will very likely stay at these high levels and lead Corsair to constant further growth. Their prediction for 2021 revenue growth is at a conservative \\~15% which will very likely be exceeded. Even with these conservative predictions the current P/S Ratio is a joke and the stock massively undervalued.\n\n[Amateur TA](https://imgur.com/a/bD14NJn) just drew some lines, look somewhere else for a propper one.\n\nOpinion: Maybe the stock will follow its upwards trend in the triangle but I think the stock is basically just waiting for any catalyst to break out. This is probably the last chance to get this under 40$. With a personal predictions of >20% revenue growth for 2021 and the rise of the P/S Ration to a conservative level of 4, the market cap should come to about 8B or an undiluted upside of 220% or 85$ a share.\n\nThe stock is experiencing relatively high volatility right now. Stocks or LEAPS are the safer option.\n\nTLDR: RGB =  \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "comments": [{"body": "CRSR dropping from the mid 40s to high 30s is a textbook example of buying the dip.", "created": 1613677380.0}, {"body": "Just bought today as well, definitely undervalued.", "created": 1613676347.0}, {"body": "I sure hope so, bought at 46 and it\u2019s been dropping ever since like everything else I buy", "created": 1613677851.0}, {"body": "I'm a fan.

Bloomberg assumed that latter last week but has since [changed its mind](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/reddit-is-chief-suspect-as-volatility-etf-swells-to-2-6-billion), postulating that it was WSB.\n\nWhile I still don't know what the volume means, I did see a lot of comments on the post that indicated that a shocking number of you people know absolutely nothing about the VIX or the VIX ETFs many of you are YOLOing. Some of the misconceptions I saw included \"lol okay gay bear\" and \"I just bought 3000 shares, looks like this is the bottom\". Both of these comments imply that you people have no idea what UVXY is and are going to lose a bunch of money if it is in fact the retail investor driving its inflows.\n\nFirst of all, the large inflows into UVXY, as I have said multiple times, do not mean people are betting on the market to fall. It could mean the opposite as it could mean hedge funds are borrowing shares to sell short and are therefore betting on the ETF to drop due to further volatility decrease.\n\nAnother thing is that the price of UVXY and VXX is not inherently bearish for a number of reasons. The first being that UVXY doesn't literally track the VIX and follow the price up or down like SPY or QQQ. UVXY is not comprised of stocks like an index fund. It is comprised of futures positions with an average maturity of 1 month and is 1.5x leveraged. Futures positions are similar to options in that they are a degrading asset. If the futures contracts bought by this fund expire below the price they were bought at, the fund realizes those losses and is then buying futures positions with a smaller money pool. Exposure in these funds is reset daily, which means that it is on autopilot buying and selling futures contracts with undeployed funds each day to maintain an average 30 day maturity leveraged 1.5x.\n\nThis means that trying to apply any type of technical analysis, chart pattern analysis, etc. to UVXY is fucking worthless. The fund does not have support or resistance levels and this is not a long-term hold. Funds like this constantly do reverse splits to bring share price and options price back to more tradeable levels. For those of you who are newer to the market, there was once a 2x leveraged VIX fund called TVIX that shut down because it ran out of money. I also want to make something very clear since there's speculation that hedge funds are buying UVXY to short. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS GME and AMC. You cannot short squeeze UVXY. ETFs are different from stocks in that market makers can issue new shares to meet demand. The feedback loop that caused the\u00a0gamma squeeze in GME would not be possible unless the issuer of the ETF halted creation of new shares. It is entirely possible to lose every penny you put into UVXY if you hold indefinitely. \n\nThe fund also doesn't necessarily rise and fall with the VIX. Over the summer, VXX and UVXY fell as the VIX went up on a pretty consistent basis. This was when Softbank was buying a bunch of calls and driving up options premiums. Even though the VIX was going up, VIX futures did not do so because there was not a strong expectation that the VIX was going to spike over the course of the following months. The fund makes money due to sharp volatility increases such as during a correction, when the underlying VIX increases 10%+ on a single day. The fund does not make money when there is sustained, relatively high volatility. You can [go here](https://www.proshares.com/funds/uvxy_daily_holdings.html) to look at what contracts UVXY is currently holding. Currently, it has March and April contracts in a proportion that exposes it to an average 1-month maturity.\n\nIf you do want to buy this fund based on historic VIX support and resistance levels and a bet that a correction is coming soon, you need to look at the actual VIX, which cannot itself be traded. Currently, the real VIX is at 23.76, at around the area it was at the end of February 2020 before the market crash. At that time, UVXY was at about $15.00 per share. Right now UVXY is near all time lows, but the VIX itself is still elevated relative to historical standards. In October 2017, the VIX went as low as 9, less than half of current levels, and the price of UVXY was still around $15.00 per share. If you think the VIX is irrationally at a historical bottom, you're wrong. It is near the bottom of a range it has been fluctuating between for the last 6-9 months, which is roughly 20-40.\n\nIn order to understand the supports and resistances of the VIX you need to understand what comprises the VIX.  The VIX \"measures fear and uncertainty\" by aggregating the premium people are paying for OTM options on S&P500 stocks. The idea is that demand, and therefore price, for OTM options contracts goes up if people are hedging more in either direction. This is how the VIX went up during a bull run over the summer. The market, especially retail investors, were willing to pay more for options premiums and demand was especially high due in part to SoftBank's aggressive call buying. The VIX also spikes during corrections because the demand for puts goes up. People don't know how deeply they have to hedge during a correction and will pay up for puts way OTM. That's why VIX spikes are generally, but not necessarily, considered bearish.\n\nSo the best way you can use the VIX isn't necessarily by buying into VIX ETFs like UVXY. Instead, one might want to use it as an indicator for buying or selling SPY. For example, since the VIX is near a support level right now, one might bet on it bouncing off that support in a broad selloff or breaking through that support as the economy continues to recover. You can also look at the VVIX, the derivative of the VIX, to get an idea of how fast options premiums are changing at a given time. VVIX will rally as options premiums go up or down and generally indicates that people are repositioning. A peak in VVIX indicates that repositioning is done and can precede the last leg of a trend. VVIX will go down as people hold their positions and wait for things to play out.\n\nEdit (2/19) - TLDR:\n\n1. VIX ETFs are not the same as the VIX. You cannot buy the VIX. ETFs track VIX futures and are not a diamond hands play - you can lose every penny (see TVIX). Look at the real VIX to determine entry/exit points.\n\n\n2. Now isn't a horrible time to play UVXY or another VIX ETF. The actual VIX is [near the bottom](http://imgur.com/gallery/85Ys3WH) of its recent trading range and looks to be close to an inflection point. \n\n\n3. The VVIX, VIX's derivative and retarded cousin, just saw a big spike but [looks to have peaked](https://imgur.com/gallery/vucgyLm) based on the past 2 days. If VVIX goes down again today (2/19) a big VIX move will probably wait until VVIX bottoms. VVIX essentially measures the speed at which options premiums are changing and spikes as the market repositions. \n\n\n4. The VIX can be a useful tool.  If you want to learn some tricks on how to use/interpret/understand the VIX, read the text wall above.\n\n\n5. There is evidence UVXY is being heavily shorted right now, which is interesting, but UVXY is not vulnerable to a short squeeze and the VIX cannot be directly manipulated.", "comments": [{"body": "Will someone read this for me and tell me what to buy?", "created": 1613672491.0}, {"body": "So you telling me buying uvxy this morning was a bad call?

It\u2019s marketed by Sonos as \u201ca lighter color to complement your home and the rest of your system.\u201d\n\n[https://blog.sonos.com/en/move-lunar-white/](https://blog.sonos.com/en/move-lunar-white/)\n\nThe **lunar** white (official color) Move should compliment your **robot** white (official color) Xbox Series S and your new robot white Xbox Series Controller... think they like lunar robots?\n\nYou can start to see Sonos and Microsoft products together in a video on Xbox's official Youtube channel (October 30, 2020) -- I can't link directly to Youtube in this post or the automoderator will banish it to the shadow realm.\n\nScreenshots from video:  \n[https://imgur.com/fDPuK4e](https://imgur.com/fDPuK4e)  \n[https://imgur.com/GGbQlQo](https://imgur.com/GGbQlQo)\n\nNotice that the Sonos speakers get shuffled around between takes.  In one frame the speakers are sitting on a sofa table -- in another shot the speakers are positioned on stands (another Sonos product).  There's a deliberate effort to get the speakers into the shot.  \n\nSpeakers aside, here's a very carefully/purposefully framed shot pairing the Xbox Series S' white controller and a Sonos sub:\n\n[https://imgur.com/XdiX7H8](https://imgur.com/XdiX7H8)\n\nKeep in mind \u2014 the focus of this video is generic (\u201cYou\u2019re the future of gaming\u201d) \u2014 yet several frames focus on the (white) Series S and not the Series X, all the while white Sonos speakers appear in the background of several shots.\n\n[https://imgur.com/9tmeXEN](https://imgur.com/9tmeXEN)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nLast note on colors \u2014 it might be worth stating the obvious that the two available colors for all of Sonos products match perfectly with the Series S (\u201crobot white\u201d) or Series X (\u201ccarbon black\u201d). Put up a Sonos Arc next to a Series X and you\u2019ll see they\u2019re an exact match... or just look at this screenshot from a video posted by Panos Panay (Microsoft Chief Product Officer):\n\n[https://imgur.com/xlOW6wI](https://imgur.com/xlOW6wI)\n\nThat screenshot came from a 6-second video -- published less than 2 weeks after that official Xbox video with the same controller closeup (matching controller + Xbox + Sonos product).\n\n**That is not a coincidence.  Know what else isn't a coincidence?  Panos Panay was added to the Board of Directors for Sonos in August of 2020:**\n\n[https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2020/Sonos-Appoints-Panos-Panay-to-Board-of-Directors/default.aspx](https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2020/Sonos-Appoints-Panos-Panay-to-Board-of-Directors/default.aspx)\n\nWhile we're on the topic of Panos Panoy, here's a screenshot of an web interview he was doing with another Sonos product (turntable + accessory) in the background -- sitting right next to a box of headphones:\n\n[https://imgur.com/fng1ITj](https://imgur.com/fng1ITj)\n\nLast little nugget... if you visit [sonos.xbox.com](https://sonos.xbox.com/) you'll see that the subdomain exists (and according to an online tool I used it shows registered late in 2019 -- can't 100% verify). As of  (or for now)  if you visit the subdomain it redirects to a generic support page that discusses Groove Music shutting down.  Groove Music was Xbox's old music service, shuttered years ago.\n\nThe subdomain hasn't been used for anything... yet:  [https://web.archive.org/web/\\*/sonos.xbox.com](https://web.archive.org/web/*/sonos.xbox.com)\n\nSo what's coming?\n\n**PREDICTION #1:**\n\nSonos has its first investor's day coming up early next month and I think Sonos will announce a partnership with Microsoft -- I think Sonos Radio will become the official (ie integrated) music service of Xbox. Use your headphones or Sonos speakers. Great for both companies.\n\n**PREDICTION #2:**\n\nSonos Radio (HD) -- Sonos' premium monthly service -- will become a perk available in an upper-tier of Game Pass.\n\n**PREDICTION #3:**\n\nI also think that Sonos will announce its new headphones, which look like a carbon copy (ie, they shared a lot of the same production process) of Microsoft's new wireless headset. The only difference is that the Sonos headphones will presumably be a bit more stylish and something you would wear out of the house -- it also appears they'll have an integrated mic:\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office)[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/headsets/xbox-wireless-headset)\n\nI think the Sonos headphones will act as the \"premium\" set of headphones (and cost $250-$350) and Microsoft will retain the entry level at $99. Sonos products are already sold through the Xbox and in Microsoft's Store, so they'll just join the rest of the products.\n\n**PREDICTION #4 (BONUS!):**\n\nSonos already has a partnership with Disney -- Disney announced a few months ago that they will be ending Radio Disney. I don't listen to the station, you don't listen to the station, but according to the most recent numbers I found 30 million a week listen to it. It may not be worth it for Disney to keep it going, but that would be HUGE for Sonos' ecosystem.\n\nRadio Disney is already alive and well in Sonos today... you have to buy a Sonos product to listen to it, of course. Coincidentally, Sonos also just announced last month that they are committed to creating new, exclusive content for their radio HD service. In fact, they have a new recording studio built just for broadcasting new music.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI love Sonos as a company -- I also like the stock. I don't think Sonos is going to underwhelm with their first investor's day and announce a product and that'll be it. I think we'll see some of the predictions I outlined above come to fruition.\n\nWhat do I know, though?", "comments": [{"body": "Screenshot positions or ban", "created": 1613671648.0}, {"body": "MSFT DD....

Arguably, about 100 of these \"big law\" firms run the corporate scene in America, with other scattered mid-size firms working on big deals here and there.\n\nOne of the biggest stressors in dealing with big law firms is **billing rates.** In the world of big law, we bill clients every 1/10th of an hour (every 6 minutes). Firms like K&E bill at a **rate of $1,845 per hour** (by partner), with associates billing at rates like **$400-$800+ per hour**.

Doing basic DD, document review, contract editing, and more, will all earn clients huge bills for seemingly menial tasks. **Big law firms have been trying to find a way to outsource work that their clients increasingly don't want to pay for.** Law firms are outsourcing to India to conduct document review.

I think LYSCF is going to \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Geopolitical backdrop \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3**\n\nU.S.-China relations have soured since the Trump administration launched the trade war in 2018.  The Biden administration [has said](https://www.axios.com/biden-holds-first-call-as-president-with-chinas-xi-jinping-24fc24a6-0589-4e62-a5f5-b560eb29973f.html) that it will evaluate the Trump tariffs as a \u201cbaseline\u201d and decide what to do next.  But more critically, Biden recently [called](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/17/asia/us-navy-south-china-sea-freedom-of-navigation-intl-hnk/index.html) China America\u2019s \u201cmost serious competitor,\u201d and he is doubling down on a strong military/naval posture in China\u2019s backyard.  China is pissed.\n\n**Economics \ud83e\udea8\u26cf**\n\nThe term \"[rare earths](https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/what-are-rare-earth-elements-and-why-are-they-important)\" covers 17 metallic elements you don\u2019t remember from high-school Chemistry class.  Crap like: Lanthanum, Cerium, and Praseodymium.  Why do they matter?  Rare earths are vital components for personal electronics and military hardware.  Big Tech needs them for your smartphone display screens, and the Pentagon needs them for guided missiles, fighter jets, and submarines.\n\nBut here is the rub: China [controls](https://www.fpri.org/article/2020/10/chinas-monopoly-on-rare-earth-elements-and-why-we-should-care/) about 80% of the market for rare earths.  The \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan from President Xi Jinping seeks full vertical integration of the rare-earth industry\u2014from mining to refining to production of electronic goods.  And guess what China does NOT want?  More U.S. guided missiles, fighter jets, and submarines deployed to the South China Sea.  On Feb. 16, Financial Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/d3ed83f4-19bc-4d16-b510-415749c032c1) that the Chinese government may curb Chinese exports of rare earths to \u201chobble\u201d the U.S. defense industry. A Chinese draft bill [says](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/01/17/business/china-rare-earths/) that the Chinese government will manage the process from mining to exports of rare earths as a national strategy,\n\nEnter [Lynas Corporation](https://www.lynascorp.com/) ([LYSCF](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LYSCF:OTCMKTS)).  Lynas is an Australian rare-earths mining company, listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, and headquartered in Malaysia.  It is one of the only non-Chinese miners of rare earths.  It is not a perfect fix for the global economy; Lynas can only refine \u201clight\u201d rare earth elements and still relies on Chinese refining plants for \u201cheavy\u201d rare earths.  But this shortcoming is so concerning for the United States and EU that the Pentagon has invested in Lynas to bolster their \u201cheavy\u201d rare earth capacity.\n\n**Trade War \ud83d\udcb9\ud83e\ude96**\n\nChinese governance and media is tightly controlled, so the fact that FT reported on internal Chinese ministry debates to \u201chobble\u201d the U.S. defense industry implied they leaked the conversations on purpose.  I\u2019d surmise that they did so as a tactic for leverage in the U.S.-China trade war, in which the Biden administration is still evaluating all the Trump-era tariffs on China.  That is, Xi is thinking, \"drop the tariffs and we won't restrict rare earth exports.\"\n\nRegardless, China\u2019s move is going to send jitters for electronics manufacturers, and China has [DONE THIS BEFORE](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/business/global/29rare.html).  Announced in 2010, China imposed export restrictions on rare earths, causing shockwaves to foreign companies and the global economy.  The result for [Lynas](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LYSCF:OTCMKTS) was a 500% increase in its stock from 2010\u20132011.  The United States, Japan, and the EU [sued](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds431_e.htm) China in the WTO to stop the export quotas.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf the Chinese government carries out its rare-earths export threat, Lynas will be sitting pretty and benefit from the high prices of rare-earths as the major non-Chinese supplier.  If China does not follow through on its threat, the threat itself will still leave manufacturers and traders with uncertainty, likely bolstering Lynas\u2019 position in the market.  LYSCF is an Over-the-Counter (OTC) Equity Securities, so it\u2019s not available to some traders on Robinhood (good riddance), and there\u2019s a $7 fee to purchase on brokers like E\\*TRADE.  Still, LYSCF seems like a solid move right now\u2014if you can get your hands on it.\n\nDisclosure: I\u2019m an idiot and just bought/like the stonk \ud83d\uddff\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "comments": [{"body": "Earth isn't even rare, the whole earth is literally made of it.

In fact, the exact opposite of what you are proposing is true. INTEL makes twice in net income (profit) compared to what AMD makes in only *revenue*. Think about that. When everything is paid for, INTEL has $21 billion left over to use as they please. What would it take to get AMD to a $100 billion valuation based on these number? Some unrealistic gains in market share and new business sectors. INTEL is the current value play and is severely undervalued. \n\nYou also miss the mark by evaluating a small sector of INTEL's business. Their operating segments rake in revenue well beyond the limited chipset market. AMD is almost solely chipsets. They mention \"development services and licenses for intellectual property\" as a passing side note, of little significance.\n\nWhat you should be arguing is that AMD is a growth stock. Their potential is what you and many others are hyped about. This is great. They do have lots of room to grow and their architecture improvements are pushing technology forward. But expectations need to remain realistic. Their current valuation is not undervalued - if anything it's already overbought.\n\nI've made this argument multiple times over the previous years.

An economic reason. Bears read this and you will get it.", "text": "The market will continue to go up despite every indicator that the market should go down. \n\nPrimer: The fed uses monetary policy to control the flow of money in the system. When they want to restrict money (lower inflation) they increase interest rates and increase banks reserve limits (saying banks must keep a certain amount of cash on hand so dont loan out as freely). \n\nIn 08 the fix to the recession was to open the flood gates. We printed new money, lowered reserve requirements and lowered interest rates. \n\nWe never recovered from it (interest rates were at 4-5% and are now at 2%.) The ideal would have been increased spending to increase inflation and over time interest rates would have risen. \n\nThe problem here is in 2010 when lending started up again people were buying houses at depressed prices from their 08 inflated prices. They could exactly raise rates on the people buying the homes in 2010 because that would put them upside down on their homes (interest rate goes up home value goes down). \n\nFast forward 2020 enter pandemic. Interest rates were already low and now the fed had to lower them more so banks could lend more to: people, companies, etc. That however wasn't good enough to move the needle they needed to basically create an artificial inflation (stemchecks) so the whole thing wouldn't seize up (think last Feb). So, the Fed saved us. \n\nNow, if they raise the interest rate there will be a broad market sell off, recent home buyers could be upside down on their loans and the economy isnt anywhere near ready to come roaring back. It would kill the economy. \n\nRates HAVE TO GO UP (google Japan early 90s real estate). Yellen knows this Powell knows this. The only way to offset the market selloff then is with a UBI which will inadvertently dump back into stocks in earnings or investments. This is the catalyst for home prices to increase. \n\nHome prices will increase because a UBI will cause a rent seeking problem. Rent will go up and the price of housing will go up equal to the amount of rent. \n\nSo when home values get to high banks lose their primary money making product and will revert back to equities (stocks) which will continue to push markets higher. \n\nBasically the market will continue to climb because if it falters at this point it will trigger a much larger collapse and the fed and treasury are no longer equipped to deal with a crash. Thus it is in everyone's best interest to keep the markets up. \n\n1) interest rates low\n2) interest rates lower\n3) cant increase interest rates without a crash\n4) create artificial inflation via UBI\n5) housing prices spike, interest rates begin to go up (propped by UBI)\n6) people are priced out of buying homes, banks pour money into markets. \n\nStocks only go up.", "comments": [{"body": "Until a retard enters Fed, raises rates and breaks the cycle.

Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings\n\n> * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.\n\n> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages\n\n> * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer\u2019s e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs\n\n> * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday\u2019s highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee.

How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again\n\n> * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night\u2019s historic cold and snow that caused the state\u2019s worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII\n\n> * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. \u201cYou have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,\u201d said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It\u2019s already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/FrLUO2J.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8MNKhv6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/T3cRcfQL/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/15wRfpqK/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/968QLzv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/TP8PttvF/eram0111.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eg2VEbG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DfgMUm2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AlgBlru.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ozc7nge.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfSCc3gj/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/VvjyLWVr/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/FKuhY48.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGg4c.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sQzqUDu.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sWm5TFN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-walmart-hormel-foods-marriott-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Walmart (WMT)** \u2013 Walmart reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share, which includes a 7-cent impact from UK tax repayment.

We saw this in Tesla. What is important is revisiting your thesis every time downturns happen, and asking yourself if there is a need to panic.\n\nWhen you do that, you should realize (as you probably already have) that the stock is currently falling without any reason. Well a deeper look does give you a few suspects we could line up for further scrutiny:\n\n1.\t\u2060Corsair completed an acquisition recently;\n2.\t\u2060The general market is on a downturn. This was not necessarily the case immediately after IPO when players had not positioned and it had a negative beta in the weeks following. But now, they have, broader market implications are now more relevant.\n3.\t\u2060The float is 25% of outstanding. As the float is very low, the stock is naturally volatile. Volatility does not mean down always, it means up and down always.\n4.\t\u2060Upcoming lockup expiration which spooks some investors.\n\nI believe all of the above reasons have no material long term downward pressure to the stock.\n\nWhat matters then, you ask? Corsair is a deep value play, when it started in 1994, they were only suppliers of memory cards to over-clocking enthusiasts. There was no need to overclock yet around the year 2000 because we simply did not have the applications that needed the boost. Now we do. In 2006, Corsair saw that GPUs were increasingly more power hungry and they decided to diversify into PSU. We know now that these early decisions are what made Corsair a giant in these departments.\n\nCorsair is now attempting the same with streaming. The gaming industry is maturing, with technologies requiring typically 30 years to fully mature. Following 2000, we are now in the final decade of its maturation, we are seeing increasing numbers in streaming being consumed as content. Corsair has seen this already, and since 2018, it has been morphing into a one stop solution for streamers, from hardware, to software (hopefully soon).\n\nWe must respect the time horizon of the founder, and give him 6 years at the least to realize the fruits of his early investments into streaming, thus 2024.\n\nWith this in mind, barring any unknown unknowns, I am confident we will see a glorious two years of growth. We already see that in every metric reported by corsair in its earnings. Rising revenue alongside rising profit margins? I believe its P/S of ~2 and the management decisions made makes the stock a steal and these downturns are a great period to accumulate, just like the whales.\n\nHaving conviction makes it all okay. Having a larger time horizon would also ease the burden you currently face.\n\nPositions: [~1200 shares,](https://imgur.com/gallery/h7coopp) , 100% diversified into different price points of CRSR, no calls.

I first bought 27 shares of $BBBY during the short squeeze mania on 1/28/2021 at $36. That was fuckin stupid. But I\u2019m buying more, now, because under $30 $BBBY is a good bet. \n\nThe trend cone for $BBBY starting in March of 2020 has the stock at a price range between $31-$41 by June 2021: [$BBBY extended Trend Cone for 2021 (I don\u2019t have fancy software so you\u2019re going to have to settle for drawn-in lines).](https://i.imgur.com/O3259yh.jpg) I am expecting the price of $BBBY to exceed the $41 price for a few reasons:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-**$BBBY finally started Internet sales, closed out non-core subsidiaries, and closed underperforming stores!**  Bed Bath &amp;amp;amp;amp; Beyond creating an internet sales footprint has given them a 0 to 1 net gain in sales and profitability. The last quarterly report showed a loss over last year, but that\u2019s because they closed out their unnecessary side-hustles.  By focusing only on Home Goods they are actually very profitable right now. The next few quarterly reports are going to show very healthy profit margins. Watch this space.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-**$BBBY began stock buy-back program.** Bed Bath & Beyond began an *Accelerated* stock repurchase program pledging to spend up to $675mil over the next 3 years.  [The 2nd phase of that repurchase program, pledging to spend $150mil, will end in April.](http://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-successfully-completes-225-million)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-**Large Call Options are being placed by Institutions on $BBBY and their industry competitor $TGT.**  If you look up Call Option volume for 3/19/2021 (1 month from today) you\u2019ll see [large purchases made on shares of $TGT at $10 and $20 over it\u2019s current value.](https://i.imgur.com/Yf88xzg.jpg) And for $BBBY you will also see large Call Option [purchases, but made at $5, $10, $15, and $20 over it\u2019s current value.](https://i.imgur.com/aURBO9g.jpg) These large plays by big money players signal to me there is a ton interest in the future of the Home Goods sector. **All boats rise with the tide.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-**Short Interest at 27%.** A stock being shorted by 27% is actually really bad\u2026 usually. But, with what we saw last year with $TSL and this year with $GME, being short can actually help your stock price if the conditions are correct. And right now the conditions are Good. $BBBY has new leadership, the company is profitable, their internet presence is bringing them 0 to 1 net gains, instutions are moving their money in, and there\u2019s a stock buy-back program going on; all signs that short intrest bag holders being forced to purchase 33 million shares at some point are only going to help the price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-**Huge divergence on $BBBY.** If you\u2019re like me and follow every damn stock picking twitter account, some of you might follow Dark Pool Charts (Algo Tracking) [(@darkpoolcharts)](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts?lang=en), and on 2/6/2021 they posted about $BBBY showing huge [Dark Pool](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dark-pool.asp) trades being made on $BBBY. I reached out to them yesterday to see if there were any changes to their divergence curve for $BBBY and the sent me this: [$BBBY Divergence Curve 1/21/2021 to 2/16/2021](https://i.imgur.com/HtRP7Jd.jpg).

And for the majority of the lowlifes here, it likely has minimal impact in the way you trade (unless your margin YOLO goes horribly, horribly wrong). But for the big boys, it\u2019s a bit different.\n\nFor the children who are hopping in for the first time, imagine a scenario where a bunch of apes are trained to gamble in a casino with chips. Each game is played, chips are moved around second by second, but the apes don\u2019t materially walk out with changes in cash money until you trade the chips for money. The casino is taking care and tracking these things for you, and you don\u2019t think about it too hard because you walk away with what you\u2019re supposed to. But the pit boss is always watching what\u2019s going on, and moving the cash in the back to make sure things run smoothly. Historically, this delay (measured in days) helped the boomers and ancient folk settle the paperwork involved in trades, and has continually gotten shorter over time.\n\nT+2 is actually an acceleration of the settlement process. In 2017, the SEC finalized their move from T+3 to T+2 as standard for most market transactions. Yes, there\u2019s variability, and some are already on a T+1 schedule, but for the most part that\u2019s where we stand.\n\nSo why does it matter? Why does Citadel, and their hand up Vlad\u2019s puppet ass, focus in on that as the intervention that the likely paid off investigatory committee should focus on? While I don\u2019t have the internal data to support it, in theory, and even as stated previously by the SEC\u2019s own press release, having acceleration of the process to keep up with technological advances has a number of benefits.\n\n https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-68-0\n\nAgain, why does this matter? To you and me, I doubt you notice it much. To the big boys, it means a lot. At that macro level, liquidity gives you volume, and volume gives you profits. By reducing the barriers to settling trades, they can minimize risk to margin, improving liquidity, and thereby allowing them to perform more trades per unit time.\n\nIn the grand scheme, if this goes as planned, Citadel and other MM\u2019s will likely come out ahead in this case. The few billion they had to pay is likely a reasonable price for having a push to T+1, where they can theoretically continue to accelerate their capital growth on the scale of tens of billions of dollars over the coming years. Melvin\u2019s got their panties in knots, and rightfully so, for getting completely fucked, but Citadel may yet come out on top from all this.\n\nTl;dr I think Citadel will try to convince the panel to make moves towards a T+1 standard. It\u2019ll speed up their transaction process, and print them more and more money. It\u2019ll sidestep any actual regulation to help retail, but also avoids looking overtly like they\u2019re bullying us\n\nPositions: I dunno, stonks only go up\n\nEDIT 1 (11:45 PST): And here it is from Loudermilk. It\u2019s a clear set-up: blame the market freeze on the collateral/margin regulation, Vlad agrees, then Kenneth lines it up to say how T+1 helps \u201ceverybody\u201d (but some everybodies more than others).\n\nEDIT 2 (13:20 PST): Pretty consistent trend amongst the Republican representatives to blame settlement regulations to cause the trading halt.

Could he please teach me how to do that?\n\nAlso, this link shows that on Jan 26th GME opened at $88.56, had a low of 80.20, high of 150.00 and closed at 147.98. \u201cAbove $400\u201d is irrelevant to his case. \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/\n\nHowever, he claims to have been forced to pay $300 and $315 (per share I assume) to cover his naked short. I can only assume that this means his options were exercised automatically by his broker after-hours and that he simply didn\u2019t bother to buy the naked calls back before close on the expiry date when they were less than half of that. \n\n*63. Because of the market frenzy caused by Gill\u2019s manipulative conduct and MML\u2019s and MassMutual\u2019s failure to supervise, Plaintiff was forced to \u201ccover\u201d the options contracts by purchasing back offsetting GameStop options contracts representing Gamestop shares at unwarrantedly and unprecedented inflated prices of $300 and $315 unmoored to the true value of GameStop shares, causing Plaintiff to incur substantial loses.*\n\nIf anyone can explain otherwise, please let me know. \n\nAdditionally:\n\nPart I (1)\n\n*...In order to disguise that the aim of his social-media campaign was simply to increase the worth of his GameStop shares by creating a demand for the stock, Gill took on the fake persona of an **amateur, everyday fellow**, who simply was looking out for the little guy.*\n\nSo he thinks that people are more inclined to follow the advice of an amateur than a professional? Interesting approach. If I was building a house I certainly wouldn\u2019t take the advice of Joe next door over that of a professional builder, but maybe he would. \n\nThere are several other parts which also make me go \u201chuh?\u201d but so the automod doesn\u2019t spam me I\u2019ll finish here.

Sabre\u2019s software, data, mobile and distribution solutions are used by hundreds of airlines and thousands of hotel properties to manage critical operations, including passenger and guest reservations, revenue management, flight, network and crew management. Sabre also operates a leading global travel marketplace, which processes more than $120 billion of global travel spend annually by connecting travel buyers and suppliers. \n\nHistorically, Sabre's airline operations, booking management, and hospitality solutions platforms have been stalwart producers of revenue and profits. However, with the airline industry crushed by pandemic-related travel restrictions, Sabre saw its own business prospects sink dramatically. Sales plunged 92% in the second quarter of 2020, with losses in the first nine months of the year adding up to more than $965 million.\n\nYet Sabre is positioning itself for a bounce in airline and travel activity. Late last year, the company partnered with Google to launch the artificial intelligence-driven [Sabre Travel AI platform](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/22/why-shares-of-sabre-are-soaring-today/). Sabre and Google intend for the platform to offer customers personalized content to boost margins. As investors see that Sabre can put the past behind it and return toward a more sustainable growth trajectory, the stock could move higher, and just getting back to where shares started 2020 would represent a double from here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlwydee2l6i61.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a566df1c892081bc953e7b34f63236bd64bcb66\n\n**BRIEF SUMMARY OF BULLISH THESIS**\n\nDuring the biggest shock in history to the travel industry Sabre has been actively positioning itself to dominate the industry when travel recovers. While everyone in the industry has been getting their teeth kicked in, Sabre has been expanding their network and modernizing their business. They have been upgrading their infrastructure, forming **thousands** of new partnership deals, streamlining their workforce and cutting costs. Pre-Covid SABR was trading for around $23/share, it is currently at $12/share with a 4 billion market cap and I believe is positioned to bounce back higher than its pre-covid numbers. SABR has been able to make strategic partnerships and is better positioned to withstand and recover than its competitors. Vaccinations are rolling out around the globe and I believe there is pent up demand for people wanting to get out and travel. There is significant short interest and I believe that SABR is positioned to recover **BEFORE** the rest of the travel industry as they are actively growing their network and client base and have added 2,100 new clients this quarter.\n\n**Short interest is at 21.39% as of Jan 29th**\n\n**Sabre has $1.5 billion in cash on hand**\n\n**PRICE TARGET $30**\n\nPos: Shares, $7 and $12 leaps\n\n**Partnerships:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvkzd1x3l6i61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=de69cf0e0cca7809172d5df92d1ecbe1aac24c8a\n\nSABR has acquired RADIXX a company which has launched contactless kiosks for airport check-ins, which should be utilized by airports around the globe as airports look to do whatever they can to get travelers back safely. \n\n[https://www.radixx.com/news/radixxs-latest-product-launch-enables-contactless-airport-operations/](https://www.radixx.com/news/radixxs-latest-product-launch-enables-contactless-airport-operations/)\n\n**Info from 2/17/2021 earnings call:**\n\n**Permanently reduced annual costs by $200 million/per year going forward.**\n\n**Added 2,100 new airline and hotelier deals this quarter**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kxkbdil5l6i61.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5e664e944e04ed8a9d1e5ff46b8b52e5a1eb4e7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4prgy717l6i61.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=342f774c1523f08e493512ebc32640017e4be2ff\n\n**As the world is recovering, travel is coming back.

I think this will be great for TSM's stock price in the coming weeks.\n\nOne question I got was: how does American intervention benefit TSM?\n\nMy answer: The Chips for America Act.\n\nThe Chips for America Act intends to encourage domestic production of semiconductors and was passed as part of the most recent defense spending bill last month. The act has already been authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act and last week American semiconductor manufacturers wrote Biden a letter to fund it.\n\n[https://www.semiconductors.org/semiconductor-industry-leaders-urge-president-biden-to-prioritize-funding-for-semiconductor-manufacturing-research/](https://www.semiconductors.org/semiconductor-industry-leaders-urge-president-biden-to-prioritize-funding-for-semiconductor-manufacturing-research/)\n\nSection 9905 of the act is titled FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS AND MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS SUPPLY CHAINS and here are some screenshots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a46yqip826i61.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=885e4c63e15ce5949305716869581af1d730d707\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mbqp9d2a26i61.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=17f7f2f41415881b400ca0840ea11d09bb6dc16d\n\nYou can look at the whole act here: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6395/text)\n\nBasically the act creates a fund that can give TSM $$$ to supply the US with semiconductors, and allocates funds to \"secure the supply chain,\" i.e. secure it against China. Closer US ties to TSM is great for the company since one of the main concerns investors have over TSM is the possibility of a Chinese takeover.\n\nTLDR: Biden is being pressured to fund an act which would give TSM $$$ and help to defend it from China.

Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, as well as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are personally involved in the effort to address bottlenecks in auto companies\u2019 supply chains, a White House spokesperson said.  \nThe spokesperson asked not to be identified by name because the talks have been private.  \nTaiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views it as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence.  \nThe Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson added.  \nThe formal outreach to Taiwan follows meetings between Deese and Sullivan and U.S. auto companies and their suppliers. The auto industry is leaning on the White House to pressure foreign chipmakers and their governments to allocate supplies to the U.S.", "comments": [{"body": "Ape want defend Taiwan border.

As Lady Cathie says, the bigger the base the bigger the breakout \ud83d\ude80\n- 1 billion dollar buyback\n\nWhat I want to address here is the buyback program. The buyback can't be initiated if RKT has material information that could affect the stock price. They can only buyback once this information has been released to the public. \n\nDuring their Q3 call, they said that they have a new financial partner that they would announce in early '21 - well guess what, it's February now so it's going to be soon. If that's still the case, it's likely that they're planning to reveal this information soon, maybe even during their earnings call next week on the 25th.\n\nThink about what could happen here. Blowout earnings,  and partnership details are revealed plus the buyback is initiated. Do you not see the potential here? All of those 3 things happening in tandem will push the price up higher and on top of that you have 30% short interest, which makes zero sense to me why this company is even shorted in the first place considering how much dough they make. \n\nAnyway, I'm in with 5100 shares @ $23: https://i.imgur.com/NdM8P7y.png\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n----------------\n\nQuick edit: \"The coronavirus pandemic isn't having a deleterious effect on the U.S. mortgage market.

No perfect cancer gene for SC as a variety of genes can be implicated. \n\nUse of histology (microscopic analysis of tissue) has almost a century of data behind it with solid evidence of predictive values.

If you've already read this would appreciate an upvote for visibility!*\n\n**TLDR: GameStop\u2019s Congress hearing is on Feb 18th, they need to investigate the Prime Brokers and DTCC for their complicity in enabling naked shorting within GME and by extension, potential collusion to shut down trading on Jan 28th, the day the short squeeze was going to kick off.** (stick to the end for an analysis of some illegal tactics short side hedge funds have been using)\n\nThesis: On the day the retail market for GME shut down on 1/28 (the day the short squeeze would\u2019ve happened had there been no market intervention), DTCC (clearing house monopoly) shut down retail buying in order to protect itself and Prime Brokers **(which privately own the DTCC)** from being exposed to the consequences of being party to illegal activity. I believe Prime Brokers and DTCC need to be called to the GameStop hearing on February 18th to be questioned for their complicity in enabling illegal naked shorting of the GME stock, as well as potential collusion to shut out retail buyers on 1/28.\n\nIn my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/) (which I recommend reading for some context) I explored the subject of rampant illegal naked shorting in GME, and how Prime Brokers (consisting of banks like Goldman, Morgan, etc) and DTCC would be complicit in the naked shorting. This in turn raises the thought experiment that they would be incentivized to do anything possible to prevent the short squeeze from happening on 1/28 because had the short squeeze happened, the shorts would go bankrupt and their Prime Brokers who lent them their naked shorted shares would need to cover the shares. This would not only represent a humongous capital expense for Prime Brokers, the culpability of Prime Brokers (and that of the DTCC) in this situation would also have likely been exposed as well.\n\nA quick primer on what a Prime Broker is: Prime Brokers are essentially the service side of the short- selling business. They lend out securities and cash, you can think of them as the \u201chouse\u201d in a casino: They provide a gambler with markers to play and to manage his winnings. According to Matt Taibi, \u201cUnder the original concept, if a hedge fund that wanted to short a stock they would first need to \u201clocate\u201d the stock with his Prime Broker but as time passed, Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge-fund customers to use automated systems and \u201clocate\u201d the stock themselves, and what this does is enable short-sellers to sell stock without delivering and thereby perform naked shorts with counterfeit shares.

(I highly recommend you read[ Matt Taibi\u2019s article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/) on naked shorting and how it was used to take down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. There are so many parallels with GME it\u2019s hard to miss. It\u2019s amazing to consider that 12 years after this article was published and brought to public awareness, the problem of naked shorting still exists as a systemic issue.)\n\nPrime Brokers have a long history of being associated with naked shorting. To highlight a few examples, Prime Brokers like Merill Lynch and Goldman have long been implicated for naked shorting Overstock.com ([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/), [https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx\\_lm\\_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f](https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx_lm_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f)). Another example is when Goldman\u2019s Prime Brokerage was implicated by the SEC in 2016 and got away with a small fine of 16 million (Source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)). An example that very recently came in the news is a story where CIBC, BOA, UBS and TD Bank Prime Brokerages are accused of facilitating naked short selling and using counterfeit stock to attack and bring the stock price of a company from $34.77 to $1.83 (Source: [https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\\_id=224548](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548)).\n\nThe DTCC also has a very long history of being associated with naked shorting. The Wall Street Journal noted that 1% of the DTCC\u2019s volume end in failure to deliver which \u201c**have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices\u2026 DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** \u201d (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)). The DTCC has also had numerous complaints submitted to the SEC for enabling naked shorting (source: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm)) and have been sued tens or hundreds of times for assisting naked shorts (source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/) and [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) and [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))\n\nOn 1/28 Robinhood received a letter from the DTCC at 4 am requiring them to halt trading or come up with [3 billion dollars](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/), which Robinhood did not have, and therefore with one swoop of the pen the DTCC shut down buy side momentum but strangely allowed selling. Retail investors were shut out of the market and as any student of microeconomics would know, by shutting buy but only allowing sell, the price is bound to fall. Meanwhile while hedge funds were able to keep trading not only in the market but also [crosstrade in the dark pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/) (\u201cprivate\u201d stock markets that retail is shut out of, more on this later), and use this crucial lifeline given to them by the DTCC to prevent the squeeze from happening that day.\n\nWith retail abruptly being shut out from buy (even cash accounts were shut out, which didn\u2019t make sense) and only allowed to sell, almost everyone could smell manipulation was afoot (which triggered the Congress hearing) and the most of the blame was pointed at Robinhood. Personally and in hindsight, I believe Robinhood was just a willing scapegoat. When we think about who had the most to lose if a short squeeze occurred, I\u2019ll narrow it down to three entities, Shorts and their stakeholders (ie Citadel), Prime Brokers and the DTCC.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the actual impetus that triggered the shutdown of the market for retail investors came from the DTCC. Working backwards, if you consider that GME was rampantly naked shorted and DTCC and Prime Brokers would have to be complicit in it, I believe the DTCC, Primer Brokers and possibly Citadel (who provides 40% of Robinhood\u2019s revenue) brazenly manipulated the market on 1/28 by shutting down purchasing for retail buyers to prevent the squeeze from being squoze on that day as doing so would be catastrophic for all aforementioned parties involved. **I believe that on the upcoming Gamestop Congress hearings the Financial Services Committee needs to call on decision makers of DTCC and Prime Brokers explore their role and complicity in the shut out of retail buyers that day as well as being enablers of naked shorting in GME.**\n\n**The main Prime Brokers (based on assets held under custodianship) of Melvin Capital are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan** [**https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf**](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)**, all three firms sit on the board of the DTCC** [**https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board**](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board)\n\nAn interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if Prime Brokers had margin had called the shorts, they would presumably also also gone down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call and instead the most logical option would probably would have been to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think most likely happened.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read up to this point, you might be thinking what can I do about this? I am aware that there a lot of cynicism that we can\u2019t do anything, that there will be no justice for retail investors who were harmed this situation, and that institutions and people in power will prevent anything from being done. I feel this sometimes too, but remember:\n\n**A single voice can be drowned out, but if we all speak together then we will make our voice heard. Ape Strong Together.**\n\nWith the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing\n\nHouse Financial Services Committee: [https://twitter.com/FSCDems](https://twitter.com/FSCDems) email: FSCDemsPress@[http://mail.house.gov/](http://mail.house.gov/)\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://twitter.com/AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC), email: [us@ocasiocortez.com](mailto:us@ocasiocortez.com)\n\nAl Green [https://twitter.com/repalgreen](https://twitter.com/repalgreen), email: [al.green@mail.house.gov](mailto:al.green@mail.house.gov)\n\nMaxine Waters [https://twitter.com/maxinewaters](https://twitter.com/maxinewaters), email: [https://waters.house.gov/contact/email](https://waters.house.gov/contact/email)\n\nSenator Toomy [https://twitter.com/SenToomey](https://twitter.com/SenToomey), email: [https://www.toomey.senate.gov/contact/email-senator-toomey](https://www.toomey.senate.gov/contact/email-senator-toomey)\n\nNancy Pelosi Email: [https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi) email: [americanvoices@mail.house.gov](mailto:americanvoices@mail.house.gov)\n\nAnd you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to: [https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm)\n\n*Edit (Adding based on a reader's comment): In your letter to your congressman, please ask to request the Congressional Research Service(CRS) to publish a report on the matter. CRS is Congress\u2019s private think tank. If they publish a report, IT WILL be read throughout the Hill, and taken more seriously than anything we could ever do as constituents*\n\nWhat follows should probably be a separate post, but I will take the opportunity to summarize some of the illegal tactics that shorts have been identified to be using in their war with retail investors. Note that this may not be an exhaustive list and there may be newer tactics deployed in the future. Retail investors might not have the same tricks, resources and willingness to break the law for profit as hedgies do, but my hope and belief is that if we pool our knowledge and analysis, we will figure out their game and effectively adapt.\n\nFeel free to forward the list below to any representatives and lawmakers if you concur that these tactics were used:\n\n**Rampant Naked Shorting -** With the [extremely high number of Fail to Delivers (FTID](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)) , [short interest being as high as 226% recently](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl), [and institutions alone holding a staggering 177% of the total float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the) (likely due in large part to counterfeit shares), signs strongly point to GME being rampant with naked shorts and counterfeit shares. I believe the original goal of shorts was to drive GME to bankruptcy with these naked shorts, using [the laddering of naked shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) (aka short ladder attack), executed with the help of counterfeit stock which is a classic and reliable method of driving down the stock price. I believe the GME stock has seen relentlessly aggressive short attacks, especially on the week of Monday February 1st, which drove the stock price down and triggered panic selling.\n\n**Masking Shorts with by Shorting ETFs that hold GME** (Can't link due to WSB, will put in comments)\n\n**Ladder Attacks with the help of Dark Pools** \\- Another identified method of ladder attacks was identified to come from [crosstrading with darkpools (the stock market has its own private stock exchange where institutions can trade\u2026)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/). Essentially darkpools are private stock markets retail investors do not have access to, where short side funds can purchase securities \u201coff market\u201d and then sell \u201con-market\u201d, with the effect of creating a lot more downward pressure on the market without the upward pressure from buying.\n\n**Illegally masking shorts with synthetic longs**. Another tactic shorts are suspected of using in GME is the use of illegally using options to evade short positions in violation of Reg SHO which SEC describes in [this risk alert](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-151) and which I elaborate in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). Essentially it\u2019s the use of using options to create synthetic longs to illegally and artificially cover and prolong short positions and at same time obscuring the true short interest %. If you consider that it would be far more profitable for shorts to not cover at high prices but instead ladder attack the price and wait for retail investors to lose interest and close their shorts at as low of a price as possible, then you can see why this strategy would be very effective.\n\n**Using way out-of-money call options to obscure true short interest.** You may have heard about the 43 million worth of 800 dollar calls purchased when the price was 100 and found it odd. Later it was identified as a tactic to cheaply purchase synthetic call options (since at 800 its way out of money) to obscure their short positions (with the added benefit of hedging at 800 if a squeeze does happen)\n\nOne thing I want to note, particularly to legislators at the GameStop hearing: Retail investors were not incited to pump GME. **Retail investors spotted a unique Short Squeeze opportunity created by the greed of short side hedge funds**, whereby GameStop was being abusively naked shorted with the goal of bringing it to bankruptcy, and hedge funds were so greedy about it that they shorted the company with a short interest of 226% of float, meaning A LOT of counterfeit shares were being used to short the company. **Retail investors saw this as an opportunity to short squeeze the hedge fund shorters, which is a legal and legitimate investment strategy**. The short squeeze would have happened had everyone played fair, but instead, financial institutions who were culpable to the naked shorting intervened and shut down retail buying, hurting the retail investors and successfully manipulating the market. The investment itself was in my opinion a sound decision based on the short squeeze, but in hindsight retail investors did not seriously consider the risk of the market would be blatantly and publicly manipulated and that the market would be rigged against them.\n\nIf this post was useful (and I hope it was! Gave up my Friday night to write this for you Apes), please upvote for visibility and share it far and wide. **The GameStop hearings could be a first step and hope towards legislative change, and it\u2019s extremely important that the right story is told at those hearings (and by the right story I mean the real truth of what happened**.) I hope the truly culpable parties are investigated and brought to justice. Again, I know many of us feel cynical that anything meaning will be done towards finding justice against the lawbreakers in this case, but **if you feel even an ounce of injustice or empathy at how retail investors were unfairly harmed in the course of investing in GME, I strongly urge you to contact a legislator associated with the GameStop hearings and bring this to their attention so they can review this case with more complete information. In addition I recommend you to contact the SEC and any journalist you know or via journalist tip lines. It\u2019s not going to be easy but the more awareness we raise the higher the likelihood our voices will be heard and positive change will be made.**\n\nPs. If you\u2019ve read to the end, I\u2019ll leave you with a few more thoughts and reminders:\n\n\\- If I were to distill life into one thing, it would be to never lose hope.\n\n\\- Remember that if you\u2019ve lost money in any way shape or form, don\u2019t be depressed, money can always be made back and the important thing is to maintain a good attitude.\n\n\\- Only invest what you can afford to lose.\n\n\\- Perhaps the most important factor in good investing is patience.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to read more about counterfeiting stocks this is a good place to start [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor, I just like the stock.*", "comments": [{"body": "Please u/zjz don\u2019t remove this one.

Your written testimony is spot-on and I truly wish you the best in everything. You certainly have a number of people around the world who appreciate who you are, and I think you are the best of us. I could not think of a better representation of the good in this world, let alone this retarded ban of apes on Reddit. \n\nThe internet is a wild place. Any one of us retards could have hit the lotto by randomly buying leaps in some meme stock then proceeding to act like a sevant even though it would have been just dumb luck. \n\nBut you were different. You did your homework for years, learning about the market and understanding what your strategy would be, all while taking care of your family and no doubt just being an all-around good dude through some incredibly difficult times since 08\u2019. I was amazed to find you when I saw your analysis of GameStop about a month ago. Sincere, funny, and most importantly, incredibly sharp. You earned every single penny of your gains through years of honing your analysis skills to find DeeeeeeeepFuckingValue. \n\nI just wanted to say thank you.\n\nPositions:\nGme to the \ud83c\udf19 \nI like the stock and I like DeepFuckingValue", "comments": [{"body": "Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain\u2019t callin\u2019", "created": 1613610049.0}, {"body": "I will donate 100 dollars to DFV\u2019s favorite charity if he comes out in a red headband.", "created": 1613611025.0}, {"body": "The only thing his testimony was missing is Comic Sans.\n\nI loved every double spaced line of it.", "created": 1613610129.0}, {"body": "This type of homo erotic shit is what I like to read in WSB. Gets the juices flowing. Cant wait for the WSB movie to come out so that inevitably we get a porn parody version of the movie. Wanna see Johnny Sins as DFV wearing a mullet wig, plowing everyone while checking his phone and watching GME squeeze and then we get a cut to some virgin twink guy to play Vlad crying as RH crashes, gets stuck in a sofa and his 7 foot tall stepbrother Tyrone walks in with his boys Junebug and Juicy.", "created": 1613612587.0}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created": 1613610586.0}], "created": 1613609781.0}]}
